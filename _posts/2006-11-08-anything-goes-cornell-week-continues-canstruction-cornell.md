In response to our [plea](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/we_knew_there_was_something_we_forgot.html), a reader alerts us to this worthy event: [CANstruction Cornell](http://www.cornell.edu/events/profile.cfm?id=18781&instance=2006%2D11%2D08%2000%3A00%3A00%2E0&y=2006&m=11&d=8&show=today) (&#8220;We Can and We Whale&#8221;), a &#8220;giant scultpure of a blue whale made of 5,000 tuna, sardine and corn cans,&#8221; on display all today in Olin Library. We feel sorta bad making fun of something that benefits charity &#8212; the food is donated to local soup kitchens and other groups &#8212; but then again, we are talking about a giant scultpure of a blue whale made of 5,000 tuna, sardine and corn cans.
