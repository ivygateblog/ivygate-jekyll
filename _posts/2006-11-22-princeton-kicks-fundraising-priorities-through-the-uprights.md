Powers, now a portfolio manager, who this week donated a whopping $10 million to those kids who are truly in need: [Princeton football players](http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S16/38/78I88/index.xml?section=topstories).

Now, you can argue that the Tigers don&#8217;t need the money. They are Ivy League co-champs, and they do play in a beautiful new stadium (to be renamed &#8220;Powers Field,&#8221; naturally). But this team has had just four winning seasons in the last decade. That&#8217;s almost as bad as the crisis in Darfur.

But before all you readers in the Holy See rush off to start the canonization papers, there&#8217;s something you should know about Powers. He &#8230; didn&#8217;t give all he could. No, the bastard held out on us, alloting another $500,000 for the school&#8217;s financial aid effort.

Son of a bitch. Doesn&#8217;t he know a half mil could have re-sodded an _entire practice field_?
