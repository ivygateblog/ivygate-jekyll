Life as the William H. Prusoff Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at Yale has its ups and its downs. One day, you&#8217;re [winning the $1 million Dan David Prize](http://www.yale.edu/opa/v34.n21/story3.html) for research into cellular <span class="ArticleText">signal transduction (might help cure cancer, no bigs); the next, <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=34517">your former secretary files a lawsuit</a> for wanton sexual harrassment dating to day one of her tenure.</span>

<span class="ArticleText">The complaint, <em>Mary Beth Garceau v. Yale</em>, alleges a lot</span> <span class="ArticleText">about Prof. Joseph Schlessinger</span><span class="ArticleText">, from jokes about penis size to bragging about conquests (46) to the scholarly exchange above. Yale did nothing to stop the harrassment despite her frequent complaints, Garceau says; a spokesperson for the university tells the <em>YDN</em> that they&#8217;ll fight the suit in court. (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0151290/stories/garceau_v_yale.pdf">Full PDF</a>)<br /></span>

Garceau also alleges that Schlessinger showed her a photo of a naked woman and claimed it was his wife &#8212; at which point his wife walked in the door and started yelling at him. That&#8217;s wrong and stupid and crazy enough. Wronger, stupider, crazier: his wife, Irit Lax, _is an assistant professor [in the same department](http://info.med.yale.edu/pharm/faculty/index.php?bioID=13)_.
