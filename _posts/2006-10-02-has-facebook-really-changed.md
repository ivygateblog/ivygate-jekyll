With millions more users! Right? Anyone? Seriously, can someone please confirm this, because we &#8212; and, we&#8217;re guessing, the vast majority of Ivy Leaguers &#8212; don&#8217;t know anyone who has joined Facebook since Zuckerberg [took the velvet ropes down](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2210227130).

This should come as a shock. Remember that great upheaval when students found out Facebook was no longer all theirs? News Feed was the new Agent Orange! We burned Zuckerberg in effigy! Finally,&nbsp;a [rallying cry](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/black_tuesday_well_never_forget_where_we_were_1.html) for our generation!

But when Facebook went public, and another outcry seemed logical &#8230; everyone shut up. Where was the flood of skeezy shadeballs without &#8220;.edu&#8221; email accounts? Our theory: The change never registered because _Ivy Leaguers don&#8217;t know anyone who didn&#8217;t attend college_.

Whatever. The next great reason to hate Facebook is [already about to hatch](http://www.adweek.com/aw/iq_interactive/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003189680).
