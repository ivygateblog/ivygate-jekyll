Thank God for faux-ironic marathons of MTV reality shows! The other night we even watched the season premiere of Laguna Beach. Or, more accurately, we wanted to play a drinking game and Laguna Beach happened to be on. It&#8217;s easy: Every time someone says &#8220;like,&#8221; you take a swig. We recommend a full keg and a siphon if you plan to keep up. Whoever makes it to the first commercial break wins.
