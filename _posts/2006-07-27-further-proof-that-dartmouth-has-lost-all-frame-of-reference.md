It&#8217;s **Camp Dartmouth**, when sophomores stay on campus to take classes like &#8220;engines 3&#8221; and &#8220;Exploring the Universe.&#8221;

_The Dartmouth_ has a special section out for the festivities called&#8230;&#8221;[Summer Lovin&#8217;](http://www.thedartmouth.com/section.php?section=mirror&date=2006-07-25).&#8221; Presumably the freshman-year seed-scattering rituals are over, and now it&#8217;s time to find a spouse while you&#8217;re both still carefree and nubile. **(Rumor has it that 60 percent of Dartmouth students marry other Dartmouth students. Creepy, agreed.)** So what do they give you? A bunch of [weak](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006072005010) [attempts](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006072005020) to debunk the claim that Hanover, N.H., is &#8220;where romance comes to die.&#8221;

It&#8217;s pretty clear these columnists are pedaling against the wind. &#8220;Let it suffice to say that, while I may not currently be in a relationship at Dartmouth (don&#8217;t waste your pity, I&#8217;m allergic), they do exist,&#8221; writes one student. The articles find an easy scapegoat for the love shortage: alcohol. C&#8217;mon people. Don&#8217;t fault booze for your crappy love life. Only the unskilled carpenter blames his tools.

But the Drinking Alone Award goes to Daniel Belkin, the columnist who claims that not only are Dartmouth campers failing to romance each other, they [can&#8217;t even make new friends](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006072502010). Is Hanover really such a year-round parade of sorrow?
