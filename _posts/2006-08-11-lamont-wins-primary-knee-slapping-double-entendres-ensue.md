<img width="123" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="200" border="0" align="left" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/nedlamont.jpg" alt="Lamont Wins Primary, Knee-slapping Double Entendres Ensue" />For us, the word &#8220;Lamont&#8221; conjures a few associations: anti-war activism, landed Connecticut gentry, unblinking Clockwork Orange-style eyes. But say the word to a Harvard kid and you get a different reaction. Why? Turns out Harvard&#8217;s #1 pick-up spot is-shocker-none other than [Lamont Library](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513526). (Sad? Maybe, but Harvard&#8217;s [not alone](http://www.bwog.net/index.php?page=post&article_id=130).)

<span>&#8220;Lamont is the only place on campus where you leave feeling happy every time,&#8221; one Harvard student <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=507211">said</a>. &#8220;If I could change one thing about Lamont, it would be&hellip; nothing.&#8221;</span>

<span><span>See, that&#8217;s where it gets weird. We&#8217;re all for naming buildings after dead guys. But when the guy is alive and kicking, or has a <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514068">great-grandson</a> who is, sometimes the most innocent statements sound all icky. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be working up in Lamont all night long.&#8221; &#8220;How about we hit Lamont for an hour or so, then get smoothies?&#8221; Or worst of all: &#8220;<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=509186">PARTY IN LAMONT</a>!&#8221;</span></span>

<span><span>We&#8217;ll let the Hasty Pudding take it from here.</span></span>

<span><strong>There&#8217;s more!:</strong> The only thing that gets Connecticut lefties hotter than Ned himself is Ned&#8217;s daughter, Emily Lamont, H &#8217;09. Here&#8217;s one <a href="http://www.myleftnutmeg.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=574">skeezy blogger</a>: &#8220;</span>She&#8217;s charming. She&#8217;s articulate. She shares her father&#8217;s commitment to public life and public service. And **She. Is.** **HOT****!&#8221;** <span>(Emphasis his)</span>

<span><span>We really don&#8217;t like to get involved in these things, but a Lamont-Lieberman face-off is way too tempting. So we&#8217;ll throw it out to you. Who&#8217;s hotter (or more articulate, self-possessed, whatever): <a href="http://nedlamont.com/article/40/with-his-family">Emily Lamont</a> or <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/rebecca.jpg">Rebecca Lieberman</a>? Cast your vote in the comments section. The winner gets IvyGate&#8217;s endorsement, if you know what we mean.</span></span>
