If you live on a street named after a tree, that&#8217;s an easy one. The first is George W. Woodruff (&#8220;The guy who was Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s Secretary of the Interior?&#8221; you ask. The same!), who won 124 games for the Quakers from 1892 to 1901 and was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1963.

The other is current coach Al Bagnoli, who is 103-36 in his 15 years on the sidelines of Franklin Field.

But if _Daily Pennsylvanian_ columnist Josh Hirsch (along with a growing number of Penn alums) [gets his way](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/10/30/Sports/Josh-Hirsch.Penn.Football.Has.Hit.A.Low.Point-2409162.shtml?norewrite200610311837&sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com), Bagnoli&#8217;s days may be numbered. Why? Because he lost two straight years to &#8230; wait for it &#8230; _Brown_!&nbsp;

Is this why Penn is so good at sports? Because they don&#8217;t tolerate even a little losing? The Ivy League has always been a safe haven for underperforming coaches. Exhibit A: Harvard men&#8217;s basketball coach Frank Sullivan, who is somehow the longest tenured coach in Ivy League basketball despite never winning a title and boasting a league record of 166-229. Canning Bagnoli would hardly be deserved, but it might keep Penn on top.

Don&#8217;t worry Bags, if you do get fired it won&#8217;t be that bad. You&#8217;ll have even more time to work on your [amazing tan](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/bagnolitan.jpg) [NSFW].
