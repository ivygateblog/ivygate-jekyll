Oh, it&#8217;s _on_.

Anticipating a move like this, we had a conference call today with counsel from the [Student Press Law Center](http://www.splc.org) in Arlington, Va., a truly wonderful organization that dispenses pro bono legal advice to college journalists (and, uh, us). We&#8217;re confident that we have a valid fair use claim to Aleksey&#8217;s video &#8212; but formally contesting YouTube&#8217;s action would just take too long. So here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do.

We&#8217;ve posted the clip to [Veoh](http://www.veoh.com/videoDetails.html?v=e1336748NgyMqyG), and just in case they remove it too, you can access it directly here, on our own servers.

We saw Aleksey&#8217;s first [cease and &#8220;disist,&#8221;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/well_be_sure_to_show_this_to_our_lawyers_when_theyre_out_of_class.html) and we&#8217;re not scared. Mr. Vayner? Mr. ron706@aol.com, Esq.? Bring it, sirs.

**UPDATE:** Turns out that serving up the enormous video file blew the roof off our server. We&#8217;ll let Veoh host for now, and re-host it if they take it down.
