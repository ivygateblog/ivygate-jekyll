Regardless, we&#8217;re pretty sure that&#8217;s exactly what Michael Berube is doing to us now. If you don&#8217;t know what we mean, take a look at the latest numbers coming out of the [Weblog Awards vote tally](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_educational_blog.php). Berube&#8217;s lead has become so unspeakably huge, we&#8217;re embarrassed to even link to the poll. [Come _on_, people. Where&#8217;s the overcompetitive spirit that earned you that fat envelope?](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_educational_blog.php)

Truth be told, this Berube guy is starting to grow on us. He plays hockey. His list of sworn enemies includes David Horowitz (read some choice parry-thrust [here](http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=4811)). _And_ he [tells off](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/12/urgent_we_need_your_help_michael_berube_this_means_war.html#comment-9008) insane commenters on our own blog. Who knows what he&#8217;s like in the classroom, but online, he seems like a stand-up guy.

Which is **by no means** to suggest he deserves to win. Given his numbers, Berube must have armies hitting up every computer lab, wireless hub, and Apple Store in the state of Pennsylvania. No doubt his American lit students are hacking the Weblog Awards mainframe as we speak. Meanwhile, our silence has cost us: about the only difference we can detect between voting on Sunday (when we were down 50) and Monday (500) is that we haven&#8217;t written a GOTV update. So damn propriety, screw bloggish indifference, and to hell with this Penn State charmer!

**[Vote!](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_educational_blog.php)** And **[don&#8217;t stop voting](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_educational_blog.php)** until you see Michael Berube&#8217;s willowy concession speech atop his blog! Although: Whatever happens with Berube, we&#8217;ll bite the suicide capsule before we let [the homeschoolers](http://www.spunkyhomeschool.blogspot.com/) take the trophy.
