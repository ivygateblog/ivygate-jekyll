Extra! Hot off the presses! Meaning, downloaded from a [Web site](http://eye.columbiaspectator.com) slightly ahead of its formal publication date! God, publishing today is boring. Anyway, here&#8217;s your first look at the Columbia _Spectator_&#8216;s new [sorta-Bee-less](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/wintour_spawn_quits_spec_magazine.html) weekly magazine (click to embiggen); we&#8217;ll do an update once we&#8217;ve had a chance to read it.

UPDATE 10:30 a.m.: Breaking! Title of publication is obscure Jane Jacobs reference! Something about &#8220;eyes on the street.&#8221; Where is this damn Johnny Depp story already?

**First major impression**: It&#8217;s funny. The editor&#8217;s note is witty, there&#8217;s a spot-on clique breakdown (&#8220;If I go to one more party where everyone is sitting in a circle, smoking pot, and talking about Animal Collective, I will jump off a building&#8221;), and one intrepid reporter profiles the city&#8217;s best toilets.
