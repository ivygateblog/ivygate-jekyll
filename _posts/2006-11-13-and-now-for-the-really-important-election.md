The leaves are turning in Cambridge, and you know what that means. Drama at the _Harvard Crimson_! Yes indeed, the elaborate changing of the guard known as the &#8220;Turkey Shoot&#8221; is under way, and we got ringside seats. We don&#8217;t really understand all the steps that lead to picking each year&#8217;s editors &#8212; something horrifying about &#8220;schmoozes&#8221;&nbsp;&#8212; but one element is simple: the 2,000-word proposals each candidate submits as part of his/her bid to become the paper&#8217;s 134th president and editor-in-chief. We got our hands on this year&#8217;s proposals, and believe us when we say there&#8217;s only one true choice for &#8217;07. A summary of the four contenders:

**Daniel J. T. Schuker:** What&#8217;s Danny Schuker&#8217;s strategy for the _Crimson_? Well, although podcast wiki Interweb e-biz 2.0 RSS, Bluetooth megahertz vblogs could, theoretically, mailbox snapping turtle IMAP syndication.

Okay, enough. But seriously, this is a guy who actually uses the word &#8220;cyberspace.&#8221; It&#8217;s all about the Web: Schuker envisions thecrimson.com in 2017 having absorbed the roles of eBay, Craigslist and Facebook on campus. News &#8212; gathered, presumably, by undergraduate cyborg-reporters &#8212; will primarily be delivered via streaming web content to mobile phones.&nbsp;

Summary: Number of times the word &#8220;news&#8221; appears: 2. &#8220;Web&#8221; or &#8220;website&#8221;: 15. Care to join IvyGate, Daniel?

**Evan Henry Jacobs:** Like Schuker, Jacobs is all e-this and dot-that,&nbsp;but with an emphasis on journalism. Web stats become the new metric for newsroom pissing matches; new web design to better showcase reporting.

The important-phrase-bolding gets out of control toward the end of Jacobs&#8217;s proposal &#8212; but if it has to happen, it&#8217;s good that it&#8217;s in a section titled &#8220;Protecting Journalistic Integrity.&#8221; &#8220;We should never sacrifice the long-term integrity of our paper for short-term popularity with the Harvard community, with our sources, _or with Crimson editors_,&#8221; Jacobs writes (emph ours) &#8212; a pretty clear reference, we think, to outgoing editor Will Marra&#8217;s handling of the recent [Crimson Crisis](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/crimson_crisis_pretzelinchiefs_moves_baffle_newsroom.html).

**Alexandra C. Bell:** Picking up on the accountability theme, Bell votes for a _Crimson_ ombudsman (Crimbudsman?) to do oversight, because &#8220;everyone is fallible.&#8221;&nbsp; Her proposal is brisk and wide-ranging, although there&#8217;s not a lot to bite onto. One suggestion, for a &#8220;more intimate comp mentor/mentee&#8221; experience, clearly wants for elaboration, preferably with some chianti and Marvin Gaye in the background.

**Kristina <strike>A.</strike> M. Moore:** Kristina Moore for president! Kristina Moore for president! She&#8217;s got it all. Seriousness, check: she leads with an inspiring, workable staff diversity initiative. Web vision, check: techie innovations that actually make sense and appeal to readers, like MP3s. (And OMG she mentions us!!) Personality, check check check:

  * On selling Harvard merch: &#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t want a Crimson hat/thong for their 25th reunion?&#8221;
  * On teas with Nieman journalism fellows: &#8220;Crimeds will be lured with affection and booze.&#8221;
  * On newsroom culture: Following Marra&#8217;s lead, buying HBO will be &#8220;mandatory&#8221; for &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; in March.

Anyone who uses &#8220;bullshit&#8221; in the paragraph on what other positions she&#8217;s interested in is after our heart. Also, her name can be shortened to KriM. Is this not providence?
