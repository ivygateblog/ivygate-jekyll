An apparent suicide attempt by a student in Leverett House yesterday prompted an e-mail from Harvard College Dean Benedict Gross to the student body, respectfully edging around the details. Later that day, Gross sent out a second e-mail &#8212; presumably planned long ago &#8212; cheerfully asking students to participate in the web-based Survey of Student Well Being. An honest mistake to be sure, but jeez, couldn&#8217;t someone have caught this? (The student is in critical condition and improving at a local hospital.)
