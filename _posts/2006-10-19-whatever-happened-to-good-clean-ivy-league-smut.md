Just when you were about to complain that it was taking too long, Columbia University&#8217;s [first erotica mag](http://www.outletmag.net/)&nbsp;has splattered onto the Internet. And the only thing offensive is the color scheme.

_Outlet_ bills itself as an &#8220;erotica review,&#8221; which as far as we can tell means it rips off photos of well-endowed ladies from elsewhere and surrounds them with undergraduate musings.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s be honest here: the magazine&#8217;s primary purpose is&nbsp;boobies.&nbsp;But it&nbsp;stumbles when&nbsp;trying to enhance them&nbsp;(even further) with smug, belabored prose.

Harvard&#8217;s _H-Bomb_ was the original and better take on the baffling theme that college kids &#8212; even Ivy Leaguers! &#8212; like naked people. That rag features the boobies of actual students, and as far as we could tell from the free online &#8220;preview&#8221; (no way are we paying $5 to research this post), the layout is sophisticated, all the links work, and the thing basically oozes class.

The same is not true of _Outlet_. A student understandably clicking on _Outlet_&#8216;s &#8220;Porn&#8221; link, for example, will be redirected to the masthead. It seems like a cruel joke until you realize that all of the links take you to the masthead. _Outlet_ just loves giving masthead.

Don&#8217;t worry guys, it happens to lots of magazines.
