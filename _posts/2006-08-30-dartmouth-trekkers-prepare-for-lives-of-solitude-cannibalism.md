> &#8220;Our Trips are just plain sweet. We offer everything from canoeing to climbing and everything in between. Check out all of our different types of Trips and what your outdoor-lovin&#8217; five days will look like. And if your New York City behind is not in tip-top shape, no need to fear! We&#8217;ve got all sorts of difficulties to suit your outdoor style.&#8221;

These trips are pretty common; they might even be universal across the Ivy League. But these kids are about to spend four years at _Dartmouth_. Aren&#8217;t they going to spend enough time isolated from society, a la [Alive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106246/), as it is?&nbsp;Maybe the tiniest Ivy should offer its students a truly unique opportunity, like a trip to the mall or a nearby urban center, like White River Junction or Concord.

Also, what do they mean by &#8220;New York City behind&#8221;? Is that like a &#8220;New York City sense of humor&#8221;? Like a JEWISH behind, perhaps? Anti-semites. Seriously, have they BEEN to Columbia lately, seen how skinny they all are? All part of a balanced diet of cigarettes and nose candy.
