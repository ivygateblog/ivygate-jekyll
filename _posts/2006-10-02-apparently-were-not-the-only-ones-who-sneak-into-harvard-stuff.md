From &#8220;[The Best Free Workout in Midtown](http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/21998/index.html)&#8220;:

> &#8220;&#8216;I didn&#8217;t think sneaking in would work, &#8217;cause, you know, it&#8217;s the Harvard Club,&#8217; says the Boston University graduate [Barton Jeffrey], who was rejected by Harvard when he applied. &#8216;But they didn&#8217;t check I.D.&#8217;s, and we strolled right in and up to the gym.&#8217; Raves another non-Harvard grad who also crashes the club, &#8216;The facilities are fantastic. Excellent squash courts, steam room, and sauna &#8212; the works.&#8217; &#8220;

In response, the Harvard Club is beefing up desk security and telling staffers to &#8220;keep an eye out for random types.&#8221; There goes our chance to towel-snap Rivers Cuomo in the ass.
