Well, looks like the _Crimson_ has done it for us.

The Harvard daily [fired](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/10/harvard_crimson.html) Ilyinsky Thursday after learning that the senior had failed to cite sources in her [column](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514975) on misuse of the word &#8220;literally.&#8221; In addition to one [passage](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/victoria_ilyinsky_were_letting_you_off_with_a_warning.html) drawn from a _Slate_ story, &#8220;two other parts of the opinion piece also do not meet The Crimson&#8217;s standards for source citation, and it is on this basis that we have decided to retract the column,&#8221; the editors wrote in a [statement](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515308) posted late Thursday.

They kind of had to. After pummeling Kaavya Viswanathan last year for plagiarism, the _Crimson_ doesn&#8217;t want to be seen protecting someone even remotely tainted by the p-word, even if it&#8217;s a small infraction. And you just _know_ the Romenesko-horny reporters smell blood in the water. As we type this, every _Crimson_ newshound is Googling Ilyinsky&#8217;s past columns sentence by sentence &#8212; desperate, desperate, desperate to become the next [David Zhou](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512948).

Evvvverybody, take a breath. A note and a retraction might have sufficed. The additional infractions that supposedly convinced the CrimEds to yank the column are no more grave than the first. Her two sources, &#8220;Literally, A Web Log&#8221; and _Slate_, are the first and third results of a Google search for &#8220;literally.&#8221; As we said before, this isn&#8217;t a high crime. (Unless other bogus columns surface!) It&#8217;s laziness, and a failure to learn the first lesson of sloppy journalism: If you can Google a topic, so can your readers.

We&#8217;ll see what happens next. (The _Globe_ [reports](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/10/harvard_crimson.html), weirdly, that the&nbsp;_Crimson_ plans to pull the article offline. If they remove it, we&#8217;ve cached the article [here](http://www.ivygateblog.com/ilyinsky%20literally.html).)

**UPDATE 5:45 p.m.:** The _Crimson_ has officially [yanked](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515328) the piece from the website. You guys realize that&#8217;s exactly the wrong move, right? Leave it up with a note attached for readers to make their own judgments.

Also, not that this is relevant, but we hear Victoria Ilyinsky is a [princess](http://www.btinternet.com/~allan_raymond/Russian_Royal_Family.htm). Literally. Like, descendant of the Romanov dynasty. We&#8217;re kind of tempted to forgive everything.
