When we said kids aren&#8217;t taking Harvard-Yale seriously this year, we hadn&#8217;t seen [these guys](http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jgc23/). A Yale rap crew called 108 Tongues just released its third annual edition of the call-to-arms anthem, &#8220;Fuck Harvard.&#8221; The song (and its [previous](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/harvard05.mp3) [versions](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/FuckHarvard2004.mp3)) gives the Crimson-Bulldog rivalry a Bloods-Crips overlay: &#8220;With thousands of pounds I got a mack 10/ Attackin from the front and the sides/ With rims on my ride/ Riding up to Cambridge commitin homicide.&#8221; Subtle it is not, but times like this don&#8217;t call for subtlety. They call for gats.

We expect some sort of response from Harvard, even if it&#8217;s just a Snoop-like call for peace. Either way, good to see the Yale hip-hop tradition that spawned &#8220;[BK2Nite](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/fool_you_cant_get_into_berkeley_tonight.html)&#8221; is alive and well.
