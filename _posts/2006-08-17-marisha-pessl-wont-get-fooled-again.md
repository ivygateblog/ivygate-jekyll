Her new book, &#8220;Special Topics in Calamity Physics,&#8221; is two parts Nabokov, one part Salinger, with some Pynchon thrown in just for shits. Just 27, she&#8217;s poised to join the Foer-Smith-Eggers club as the voice of her generation. And oh yeah &#8212; she&#8217;s _smoking_ hot, those raven locks twisting &#8217;round her alabaster face &#8230; &#8220;Gatey,&#8221; she purrs to us&nbsp;in our dreams. &#8220;Read my [flashily erudite first novel](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/books/31masl.html), a [sly satire of academia](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/books/15258195.htm) <span class="newsText">crowded with <a href="http://www.observer.com/20060807/20060807_Regina_Marler_culture_books3.asp">jokey literary references</a></span>. Enjoin my&#8211;&#8220;

No! Damn it, we will not let her gank our hearts. [Not again](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512948). Oh, Kaavya, you precedent you. Your [Schiavo-like gaze](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/kaavya_viswanathan.jpg) may not have set our hearts askitter like fair Pessl, but O! What big numbers you had. The better to seduce us with: Half a mil at age 18 for two titles, quality irrelevant. Those were figures we could get behind, salivate over, semi-plausibly obtain for our own hacky manuscripts. You took those hopes, Kaavya, and you dashed them. Or, you know, the <span class="c1">Crimson</span> did, by exposing you.

No, we won&#8217;t go down the precocious novelist road again, Marisha. Too much to lose. Hawk your prose and womanly wiles somewhere we can&#8217;t see you. That way, when the news arrives that your novel is&nbsp;_literally_ two parts Nabokov, one&nbsp;part&nbsp;Salinger, with some Pynchon thrown in just for shits, we won&#8217;t even look up from our books.
