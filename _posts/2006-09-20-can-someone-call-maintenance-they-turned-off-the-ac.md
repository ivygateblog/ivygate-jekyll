If you go to an Ivy League school, you probably find intelligence attractive. Lectures, when delivered with the right mix of _panache_ and _brio_ (while using words like _panache_ and _brio_), can be uncomfortably stimulating. Smart is hot. But it never hurts if the professor happens to be sporting her trademark leather lowriders or showing off his rugged, unshaven cheekbones. Because let&#8217;s face it: Hot is also hot.

We know, we know, you went into academia to get away from all this superficial crap. Well, we&#8217;ve got news: academics are some of the vainest (and, sometimes, veiniest) people around. If Cornel West spent as much time publishing papers as he did ironing his three-piece, he might still be at Harvard. Professors are born narcissists. For all you know, they&#8217;re paying us to announce &#8230;&nbsp;

**Faculty Studs & Tenured Temptresses of the Ivy League**, an Ivy-wide beauty pageant dedicated to finding the two hottest tickets in the Ancient Eight. Requirements: The person must be 1) a professor currently teaching at an Ivy League school, 2) in possession of a doctorate (no adjuncts, no grad students), and 3) hot. (Hot-hot or distinguished-hot is your call. We hold out hope for the former, but hey, we love us our silver foxes.)

Send your nominations by 11:59 p.m. Sunday to <ivygate@gmail.com>, with pics if possible. Our panel of judges will select the most qualified candidates and open it up for readers to vote next week.
