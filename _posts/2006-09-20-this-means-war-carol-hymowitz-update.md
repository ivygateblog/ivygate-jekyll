Everyone complains that blogs rip their material from newspapers and magazines. For the most part, it&#8217;s true: We are indeed the vultures hovering over the mainstream media&#8217;s festering carcass. But unoriginality is a two-way street, friends. Just ask Carol Hymowitz.

There we were, sitting down to our Honey Graham Oh&#8217;s, looking forward to a relaxing Monday morning with the _Wall Street Journal_ Marketplace section, when we see [this &#8220;In The Lead&#8221; column](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115853818747665842-QwZ5phDGK0glnjD6J3v_4GLLhwY_20070918.html) &#8212; and this chart in particular:

Shameless ripoff? Innocent coincidence? Carol never replied to our email, so you be the judge. All we have to say is this: You&#8217;re free to borrow the idea, Hymowitz. _But stay the hell away from our pie charts._

**BETRAYAL** **UPDATE 9:45 p.m.:** Hymowitz went to an Ivy grad school. The dagger twists.
