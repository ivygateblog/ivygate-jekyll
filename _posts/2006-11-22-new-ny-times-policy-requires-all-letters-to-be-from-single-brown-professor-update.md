Times</em> Policy Requires All Letters to Be From Single Brown Professor (UPDATE)" />Remember that time you got all riled up over a story in the _Times_ and spent hours perfecting a letter to the editor, and then _omigod omigod_ they published it? Highlight of your year.

Brown professor of philosophy Felicia Nimue Ackerman is not impressed.

For academics, the pressure to publish is relentless &#8212; but this is ridiculous. Ackerman has landed 23, count &#8217;em, twenty-three letters to the editor in the _New York Times_ since January 2005. _The woman is unstoppable._ She&#8217;s tagged the Arts and Leisure, Book Review, Editorial, Escapes, Financial, Science, Style and SundayBusiness desks, on topics from euthanasia to yurts. Two were published _on the same day_. (Complete anthology of Ackerman&#8217;s letters after the jump.) How does she have any time left to publish, say, &#8220;&#8216;Always to do ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen succor&#8217;: Women and the Chivalric Code in Malory&#8217;s _Morte Darthur_&#8221; in [_Midwest Studies in Philosophy_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0631233822/ref=sib_dp_srch_pop/102-5176477-4296901?v=search-inside&keywords=ackerman+and+pantsalot&go.x=0&go.y=0&go=Go%21) Vol. 26?*

While we&#8217;d like to label Ackerman crazy, or at least underemployed, the thing is &#8230; she&#8217;s kinda good at this.

> It&#8217;s nice that Ben Stein has so many blessings to count (&#8220;First, Tame That Envy. Then Give Thanks,&#8221; Everybody&#8217;s Business, April 9). But I doubt that the one-size-fits-all advice, &#8220;Instead of thinking about what you don&#8217;t have, think about what you have,&#8221; would have the intended effect on someone who does have cancer and doesn&#8217;t have health insurance.

Editorial page _snap!_ For the _Times_, we can imagine that FMA would be hard to resist, with that catnip &#8220;The writer is a professor of philosophy at Brown University&#8221; tag and a middle name straight out of &#8220;Whale Rider.&#8221; Or maybe Ackerman&#8217;s secret is that she just doesn&#8217;t care &#8212; this prof&#8217;s been published in better places. Like [_Playgirl_](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/faculty/ackerman/cv.htm).

*[Note: This is the first academic paper half of us has ever seen. Do they all begin with limericks about how Sir Lancelot &#8220;couldn&#8217;t keep it in his pantsalot&#8221;?]

**UPDATE Nov. 27:** We search Nexis like Kuala Lumpur populates its slums: poorly. Thanks, commenters &#8212; we looked up different variations of Ackerman&#8217;s name and found some 130 letters dating to 1987. Let&#8217;s go ahead and dial back that restraint on using the word &#8220;crazy,&#8221; above.

The Storm in the Mind of a Child
  
To the Editor:
  
I was interested to see that symptoms of mental illness in children include
  
&#8220;does not seem to listen when spoken to directly&#8221;; &#8220;often leaves seat in
  
classroom or when sitting is expected&#8221;; &#8220;argues with adults&#8221;; &#8220;skips school&#8221;;
  
and &#8220;often stays out late at night despite parents&#8217; rules.&#8221;
  
Perhaps if children had as much clout as parents and teachers, symptoms of
  
mental illness in parents and teachers would include &#8220;expects attendance and
  
attention during boring speeches and lessons&#8221;; &#8220;expects unquestioning
  
obedience&#8221;; and &#8220;makes unreasonable rules about staying home at night when
  
there are more interesting things to do outside.&#8221;

On Nonentities
  
To the Editor:
  
As a middle-aged literary nonentity who occasionally writes book reviews, I
  
was taken aback by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Franz Wright&#8217;s remark, &#8220;I cannot
  
bring myself to believe that I am the only serious follower of contemporary
  
poetry who is getting sick of reading reviews by young literary nonentities
  
posing as Randall Jarrell&#8221; (Letters, Oct. 8). I cannot bring myself to believe
  
that I am the only serious reader of book reviews who cringes when an
  
established writer is snobbish and meanspirited enough to sneer at the obscure
  
for being obscure.

ROUGHING IT IN A YURT
  
To the Editor: David Franklin and Christa Coggins may like to think they are
  
&#8220;Keeping Life Simple at a New Mexico Yurt&#8221; (Oct. 13), but showers that require
  
&#8220;hauling water in a large tank from a well&#8221; sound pretty complicated to me, as
  
do &#8220;clearing brush and chopping firewood.&#8221; I prefer the simplicity of turning
  
up my thermostat and turning on the faucets in my shower.

Staying Alive
  
To the Editor:
  
Jonathan Rauch&#8217;s review of &#8220;The Party of Death: The Democrats, the Media,
  
the Courts, and the Disregard for Human Life,&#8221; by Ramesh Ponnuru (Sept. 3),
  
endorses Ponnuru&#8217;s claim that because &#8220;abortion-rights absolutists &#8230; would
  
allow abortions even in the latest stages of pregnancy &#8230; their position gives
  
them no firm purchase from which to oppose infanticide.&#8221; This overlooks a point
  
routinely made in introductory philosophy courses on moral problems: Having a
  
right to life does not entail having a right to everything one needs in order to
  
stay alive. If it did, sick people would have a right to blood transfusions and
  
bone marrow transplants from unwilling donors and everyone would have a right to
  
whatever medical care he needed in order to stay alive, making the Republican
  
Party the party of death for opposing national health insurance.

Pedophiles, Gathering Online
  
To the Editor:
  
The pedophiles depicted in &#8220;From Their Own Online World, Pedophiles Extend
  
Their Reach&#8221; are indeed scary, but so is Bill Walsh&#8217;s claim that the pedophiles&#8217;
  
desires are &#8220;illegal.&#8221;
  
He is a former commander of the Crimes Against Children Unit for the Dallas
  
Police Department, not a former commander of the thought police. So he should
  
realize that actions can be illegal, but desires are, and ought to be, beyond
  
the reach of the law.

Left, Right and Cinema
  
To the Editor:
  
Re &#8220;An Uprising on the Right in a World That Leans Left&#8221; by John Anderson
  
[July 16]:
  
The director Wash Westmoreland suggests that conservative documentaries
  
cannot be interesting because &#8220;the origin of the word conservative is about not
  
changing, accepting what is.&#8221; But he overlooks the fact that conservative now
  
refers to a specific set of doctrines, including minimal governmental economic
  
regulation, restrictions on sexually explicit art, opposition to abortion, etc.
  
A conservative documentary can rebel against the changes liberalism has brought
  
to our society. As a lifelong liberal, I would find it refreshing to see a
  
documentary whose politics I oppose.

I&#8217;ve Got the Clone Right Here
  
To the Editor:
  
Your Side Effects columnist, James Gorman, says that &#8220;if you are anything
  
like me,&#8221; you &#8220;instinctively cheer for the natural mules&#8221; over the cloned
  
ones (&#8220;Belmont. Schmelmont. You Ought to See a Cloned Mule Run,&#8221; June 13).
  
Well, I&#8217;m not and I don&#8217;t. I cheer for the cloned mules and for the triumph of
  
human ingenuity.

Opus Dei Practice
  
To the Editor:
  
Paul Fortunato&#8217;s claim (&#8220;Opus Dei&#8217;s Box-Office Triumph,&#8221; Op-Ed, June 2)
  
that &#8220;one key element behind corporal mortification is to feel solidarity with
  
the poor and the suffering&#8221; makes me wonder how taking on a physical state that
  
the poor and the suffering wish to escape can possibly promote solidarity with
  
them.
  
If I were poor or suffering, I would rather that Opus Dei worked to relieve
  
my plight than adopted it.

Have or Have Not
  
To the Editor:
  
It&#8217;s nice that Ben Stein has so many blessings to count (&#8220;First, Tame That
  
Envy. Then Give Thanks,&#8221; Everybody&#8217;s Business, April 9).

on someone who does have cancer and doesn&#8217;t have health insurance.

Bragging Rights
  
To the Editor:
  
Re &#8220;My Parents Are the Best Braggarts Ever&#8221; (letters, Jan. 10):
  
The article and the letters about parents who brag about their children
  
remind me of one of my mother&#8217;s favorite sayings: All ordinary children must be
  
orphans, because no parent ever admits to having one.
  
And speaking of bragging about one&#8217;s relatives, my mother is now 93 and
  
still mentally sharper than most of my fellow academic philosophers.

All About Mother
  
To the Editor:
  
Re &#8220;Live Longer With Evolution?&#8221;: Information about the varying
  
Christian, Jewish, Confucian and Taoist attitudes toward greatly increased human
  
longevity and even earthly immortality is interesting. But it is irrelevant not
  
only to all of us nonbelievers but to public policy in any country that has a
  
separation of church and state.

Getting In, Getting On
  
To the Editor:
  
David Brooks&#8217;s criticism of the view that &#8220;academic merit&#8221; should be the
  
dominant criterion for college admissions, in his review of &#8220;The Chosen,&#8221; by
  
Jerome Karabel (Nov. 6), cries out for critical examination. He writes, &#8220;Those
  
old WASP bluebloods may have been narrow and prejudiced, but they did at least
  
have a formula for building character.&#8221; But what kind of character did they
  
build? A narrow and prejudiced kind, maybe?

That Job Offer From a Competitor
  
To the Editor:
  
&#8220;A Recruiter Is Calling. Should You Answer?&#8221; (Oct. 16) offers the
  
undoubtedly practical observation that a company may question the loyalty of
  
workers who try to negotiate pay increases by getting better offers from
  
competitors.
  
But how can a company expect loyalty from employees to whom it may not offer
  
loyalty in return? How many companies offer such loyalty these days?

Something to Live For
  
To the Editor:
  
I hope that &#8220;The Pablo Picasso Alzheimer&#8217;s Therapy&#8221; by Randy Kennedy
  
[last Sunday], which showed that Alzheimer&#8217;s patients have reserves of thought
  
and feeling far beyond what most would expect, will make people less inclined to
  
believe that such patients have nothing left to live for and should be &#8220;allowed&#8221;
  
to die when life-threatening illness strikes.

Nothing Wrong With the Net
  
To the Editor:
  
What is striking about the parents who &#8220;fret that dialing up interferes
  
with growing up&#8221; is the weakness of their arguments. The claim that &#8220;long,
  
sedentary hours spent in front of a computer may lead to weight gain&#8221; could as
  
well apply to long, sedentary hours spent reading. And the claim that &#8220;an
  
excess of instant and text messaging comes at the expense of learning
  
face-to-face social skills&#8221; invites two objections. First, skill in instant and
  
text messaging is itself a useful social skill for the third millennium. Second,
  
what is so terrible about spending one&#8217;s leisure time having fun rather than
  
&#8220;learning skills&#8221;? If &#8220;talking about nothing&#8221; amounts to &#8220;a waste of time,&#8221;
  
how many conversations that lack a specific practical purpose would escape this
  
criticism?

No Pandering
  
To the Editor:
  
Re &#8220;Bill T. Jones Is About to Make People Angry. Again&#8221; by Ginia
  
Bellafante [last Sunday]:
  
When I saw the headline, I thought, oh, no, not another ultra-conventional
  
artist who treads the safe path of keeping his leftist audience happy by making
  
rightists angry. But I underestimated Bill T. Jones. A gay man who publicly
  
ponders the question, &#8220;Why do I think it&#8217;s O.K. to lay with another man but not
  
to sleep with my sister?&#8221; and who says: &#8220;I&#8217;m the child of potato pickers. I&#8217;m
  
happy to join the middle class&#8221; can hardly be accused of pandering to his
  
audience.

Planning to the End
  
To the Editor:
  
Although the writer claims that his mother &#8220;was liberated when she was 80&#8242;
  
&#8216; by the death of his controlling &#8220;patriarchal&#8221; father (Cases column, &#8220;One
  
Last Recipe From Mother), this claim is belied by his statement that his mother
  
preferred to die rather than &#8220;to cause her family any inconvenience.&#8221;
  
Any woman who deems her life less important than her family&#8217;s convenience
  
has hardly been liberated from the traditional view that women should be willing
  
to sacrifice themselves for their families.
  
The contention that a terminally ill person owes her loved ones &#8220;a good
  
death&#8221; even at the price of forgoing a chance to prolong her own life has it
  
backward.
  
When a mother who has spent her life caring for her family becomes ill, her
  
children owe it to her to reciprocate the care she gave them and to have the
  
simple human decency to assure her that their convenience is far, far less
  
important than her life.

Just think how much worse American society would be today if labor leaders

organizing against brutal working conditions. And think how much worse it would
  
be if blacks had accepted the advice and not fought racial discrimination in the
  
workplace.

To the Editor:
  
The writer&#8217;s statement that the death of his father from a sudden heart
  
attack at 73 &#8220;was the envy of all his friends&#8221; (&#8220;Anti-Doctor and Anti-Death.
  
What&#8217;s a Guy to Do?&#8221;) invites a natural question: How old are his father&#8217;s
  
friends?
  
As a 57-year-old with a 92-year-old mother, I don&#8217;t regard any death at 73
  
as enviable. Unfashionable as it is to admit it, I bet lots of old people share
  
my wish to live a long, long time.
  
An enviable death?
  
How about Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at 122?

Need an Organ? On One Condition
  
To the Editor:
  
Re &#8220;In a Judgmental World, She Was Ashamed of Getting Sick&#8221; (April 12): It
  
is hardly surprising that &#8220;in a judgmental world,&#8221; there is a widespread
  
belief that people with drinking-related liver damage should not receive liver
  
transplants.

This belief is not only mean-spirited but illogical, unless it is extended
  
to apply to everyone whose illness came about through preventable
  
self-indulgence.

How many people would deny liver transplants to those whose liver damage
  
resulted from contracting hepatitis through recreational travel to an area where
  
the disease was known to be rampant? Very few, I bet.

&#8216;Fat Girl&#8217;
  
To the Editor:
  
How refreshing to find someone who acknowledges that &#8220;as the &#8216;obesity
  
epidemic&#8217; receives endless press . . . fat haters coast under the radar as
  
do-gooders&#8221; (from Jane Stern&#8217;s review of &#8220;Fat Girl,&#8221; by Judith Moore, March
  
27). But as a former fat person, I would welcome the long-overdue acknowledgment
  
of another unpopular truth &#8212; not every fat person fits the stereotype of coming
  
from a &#8220;miserable&#8221; family &#8220;that created a hole&#8221; in her soul &#8220;that she tried
  
to fill with food.&#8221; I came from a happy family. I overate for the deep
  
psychological reason that fattening foods taste terrific and eating them is
  
delightful.

The idea that people like to buy products from people they know may be the
