She received a public spanking from [other journalists](http://www.slate.com/id/2126760/), who lashed her for crying &#8220;trend&#8221;; from feminists, who accused her of rolling back the movement 40 years; and even from her own [sources](http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/on/a_note_on_sources_or_the_story_behind_the_story_26204.asp), who insisted she had omitted contradictory evidence.

And now, the nail in the coffin: A [survey](http://www.yale.edu/wc/worklifesurvey) conducted by Yale&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Center finds that undergraduate women have no plans to put parenting over work, or at least no more so than men. The sampling methods sound a little sketchy (they surveyed many more women than men, and it&#8217;s unclear how self-selective the groups were), but far less so than Story&#8217;s (ignoring inconvenient evidence, using vague phraseology to fudge pool size, using the word &#8220;many&#8221; a dozen times).

That&#8217;s gotta sting. Shivved in the back by your own Eli kind. Reminds us of the time some punk undergrads wrote a thesis debunking ours, and &#8212; hey, Louise, trend story idea!
