See it there, up top? That&#8217;s [**IvySport**](http://www.ivysport.com), IvyGate&#8217;s lovable meathead uncle. It being the holiday season and all, we thought we&#8217;d give our first beloved advertiser a big, wet kiss in the form of this post. Thanks to IvySport, we can provide you with up-to-the-semester news and gossip about the world&#8217;s most admired/hated schools, and still feed our <strike>habit</strike> kids.

So when it&#8217;s time to buy yourself that sweet [vintage Harvard crew jersey](http://www.ivysport.com/product-product_id/1001/category_id/224), or that [Princeton paperweight](http://www.ivysport.com/product-product_id/493) (it&#8217;s so heavy!), save yourself the walk to the campus bookstore &#8212; the Internet is so much closer! Clothing, kitchen appliances, ore &#8212; if you can think of it, chances are you can get it with your school&#8217;s name on it. May your future be full of Dartmouth snowpants, Brown water pipes, and Cornell Zambonis.

And here&#8217;s a bonus: Between now and Dec. 31, you can get $8 off any purchase of $10 or more. Just enter &#8220;ivygate8&#8221; as the coupon code.

We now return to your regularly scheduled libel.
