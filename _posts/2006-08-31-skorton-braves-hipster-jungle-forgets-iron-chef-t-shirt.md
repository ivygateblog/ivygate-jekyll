<img width="500" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="375" border="0" align="top" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/53.jpg" alt="Skorton Braves Hipster Jungle, Forgets &quot;Iron Chef&quot; T-Shirt" />Cornell Cornell President David J. Skorton has, if nothing else, huge balls. First he [sleeps](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/cornellgasm_president_skortons_first_day.html) among the unwashed fresh-masses, now he ventures off into the drug-doing, brow-piercing, Morcheeba-listening, God-hating, cross-dressed (but otherwise naked) den of iniquity that is [Risley Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risley_Hall).

Our undercover Cornellespondents tell us that Skorton and his wife, Robin L. Davisson,&nbsp;dined chez Risley last night. When they entered the dining hall, one student reportedly sprung up from his table and gushed over Ms. Davisson: &#8220;You&#8217;re beautiful! You make Jackie Onassis look like a crack whore!&#8221; (Kind words, but [you be the judge](http://www.cornell.edu/president/gallery/skorton_2006_announcement_photo.cfm?id=4).)

They then proceeded to eat dinner as ironically as possible.
