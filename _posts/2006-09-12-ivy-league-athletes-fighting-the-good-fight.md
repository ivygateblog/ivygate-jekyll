Yes, the phrase &#8220;Ivy League&#8221; originally referred to a sports conference. Yes, some of its teams win some of their games. (Harvard squash will totally eff you up!) But to all but the most militant boosters, the concept became pretty much a punchline a long time ago. To be fair, there is a lot of tradition in these parts, from John Heisman (Brown and Penn) to Hobey Baker (Princeton). Bill Bradley played Tiger basketball; Lou Gehrig homered in light blue. Next Monday, Ivy League Sports will kick off a yearlong celebration of the [50th anniversary of formal athletic competition](http://ivyleaguesports.com/article.asp?intID=5384). Hey, you know what? There&#8217;s stuff here to be proud of! And not just in black and white filmreel, either &#8212; Ivy teams still make SportsCenter from time to time! Why, here&#8217;s a recent clip right here: Keep doing us proud, Yale.
