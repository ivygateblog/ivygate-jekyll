  Remember how in middle school, when not enough boys auditioned for a play, they&#8217;d have to cast girls as the romantic leads? At Dartmouth the same thing just happened, only &#8230; different.

  Dartmouth&#8217;s Mainstage theater had originally planned to stage &#8220;The Negro of Peter the Great&#8221; this fall. Now they&#8217;re doing Caryl Churchill&#8217;s &#8220;Far Away.&#8221; <em>The Dartmouth</em> <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006110204020">explains</a> why (emph ours):

>   &#8220;Although we had a significant turnout by minority students, we did not have an African-American actor,&#8221; [director Peter] Hackett said. After considering possible options, including making the character transgendered, restructuring the play so that the role was shared by several actors, or hiring a professional actor, the department decided to change the play altogether.

  We can&#8217;t imagine how many awkward conversations led to that decision. At least now we know why Penn stages <em>Merchant of Venice</em> every year. (What? We&#8217;re allowed, it&#8217;s Borat opening weekend!)
