Brought to you by [_Annals of Improbable Research_](http://www.improbable.com/) magazine, the winners are the true heroes of academia:

  * Medicine: First prize went to Francis M. Fesmire of the University of Tennesee for her study [&#8220;Termination of Intractable Hiccups with Digital Rectal Massage.&#8221;](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=3395000&dopt=Citation) (Should we make a &#8220;Volunteers&#8221; joke at this point?) Fesmire&#8217;s work inspired an Israeli follow-up report of the same name with a [must-read abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=2299306&dopt=Abstract). Now if we can just find a cure for the digital rectal massage. 
  * Peace: Awarded in absentia to Welsh inventor Howard Stapleton for his stupendous electromechanical teenager repellant. [&#8220;The Mosquito&#8221;](http://www.compoundsecurity.co.uk/teenage_control_products.html) prevents youth from loitering in malls, etc., by emitting a high pitched, annoying sound that most people lose the ability to hear by their mid-20s. 
  * Literature: Daniel Oppenheimer of Princeton put the Ivies on the board with [&#8220;Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly.&#8221;](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112137622/ABSTRACT#search=) That&#8217;s the kind of wit that&#8217;ll get you a date with [Prof. Tamsen Wolff](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/prof_cannon_prof_wolff_is_there_anything_we_can_do_to_raise_this_grade.html).[<img width="264" hspace="5" height="265" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/nobel.jpg" alt="Pointless Innovation" />Harvard&#8217;s Sanders Theatre was again overwhelmed by paper airplanes recently when it played host to the [16th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony](http://improbable.com/ig.html), an our-kind-of-irreverent counterpart to that [Oslo nonsense](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/oh_yeah_and_some_guys_won_some_stuff.html) taking place across the pond.

Winners (and losers, because what&#8217;s the difference?) were honored with the Ig Nobels&#8217; [traditional paper airplane shower](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514779) and a no-strings-attached &#8220;Dr. Fran&#8217;s Anti-Hiccup Kit.&#8221; (The video&#8217;s [here](http://improbable.com/webcast.html).)
