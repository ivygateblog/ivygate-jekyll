Way back in August, we asked a [graphic design friend](http://www.eightoverfive.com/) to come up with a logo for the site. We lost track of each other, and assumed the favor was dead &#8230; and then this showed up in our mailbox. Click to enlarge. Do this. Where do we begin? The businesswoman with a kitten head? The temptress laying seductively with a Malayan tiger? Is that pot, poison ivy, or a combination thereof? We&#8217;ll be right back, we have to put on &#8220;Who&#8217;s Next&#8221; and jam a towel under the door.
