For those of you chomping at the bit to see just what was in the homemade porn picture that got Dartmouth&#8217;s Alta Delta brothers into a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006060901000">little trouble</a> this June, you&#8217;re <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006081501040">straight out of luck</a>: Local police suspended their investigation into the rumored 2003 sex tape a week ago, and say they don&#8217;t have enough evidence to make an arrest. Where&#8217;s CSI: Hanover when you need it?

Also, it sounds to us like _The Dart_ doesn&#8217;t know shit about shit. &#8220;As of now,&#8221; Phil Salinger&#8217;s Aug. 15 piece says, &#8220;a pocket of the Dartmouth community, which includes much of the AD membership, knows the names of the two individuals involved in the case.&#8221; Which two?!? How you gonna cocktease us like that,&nbsp;Phil?

Regardless: Eh. Two extremely pale people having sex? [Seen it](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/).

And speaking of homemade porn that may or may not exist, the Dartmouth tape probably &#8212; Jesus, what tense is this supposed to be in? &#8212; couldn&#8217;t match the cinematic gold allegedly created last winter by the caretaker of Elihu, the Yale secret society. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yalerumpus.com"><em>Rumpus</em></a> reports [[PDF](http://www.yale.edu/rumpus/archives/pdf/yalerumpus.com_dec05.pdf)]:&nbsp;

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Yale&#8217;s secret societies all have caretakers, but Elihu&#8217;s recently went above and beyond the call of duty. One of the society&#8217;s members happened to be strolling through the tomb when he heard what sounded like a devoted employee in one of the &#8220;secret&#8221; rooms, from which the caretaker is technically barred. Looking in, the Elihu member chanced upon the caretaker selflessly caretaking &#8212; which apparently entailed videotaping two homeless people having sex. That, folks, is how to get ahead in business. Or at least how to get a hobo to give another one a-head in business.
