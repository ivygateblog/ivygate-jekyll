Hey, remember that book &#8220;[Football: The Ivy League Origins of an American Obsession](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/13531.html)&#8220;? You know, the one that&#8217;s currently the 559,294th best selling book on Amazon. You don&#8217;t? Well, it must have made an impression on the one guy who bought it &#8211; filmmaker Erik Greenberg Anjou.

Fresh off his latest success, [_A Cantor&#8217;s Tale_](http://www.acantorstale.com/), the Middlebury grad and former Cantorial music student is turning his attention to an equally gripping topic: [Ivy League football](http://biggreenalertblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/of-brown-and-green-and-silver-screen.html).&nbsp;The film is set to be released sometime in 2007.

A documentary on Ivy League football?&nbsp;Someone must have already acquired the rights to watching paint dry and the grass grow.
