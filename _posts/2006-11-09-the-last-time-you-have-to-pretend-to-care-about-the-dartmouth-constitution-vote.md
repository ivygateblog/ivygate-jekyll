The results are in: Dems have taken control of the House, they eked out a majority in the Senate, and the much-bandied-about, brand-spankin&#8217; new Dartmouth Alumni Constitution [failed to break](http://www.voxthevote.org/) the necessary two-thirds threshold to become law. (**But** a record 38 percent of all eligible alums voted. Yeah!)

We&#8217;re not quite sure what to make of this. One one hand, the ESL &#8216;tards at _The Dartmouth_ backed the new constitution, and agreeing with them is never a good thing. On the other hand, the fascist nutjobs at _The Dartmouth Review_ opposed the constitution, and agreeing with them is never a good thing. The College spearheaded an MTV-style &#8220;Vox the Vote&#8221; campaign, which stopped just short of getting Diddy himself (where was Mr. Vote or Die in the midterm elections, btw?) to come out and stump; equally annoying were constant mailings from the Alumni Governance Task Force &#8212; the group that proposed the constitution &#8212; which was hell-bent on getting voters to vote yes, though fairly short on compelling reasons as to why.

So people didn&#8217;t. In the end, the constitution was divided along the same line that most things Dartmouth are: grumpy old frat boys who want to keep Good Ol&#8217; Dartmouth the same (those against), versus those newer alums who are eager to see the changing of the old guard (those for it). The Old Boys won.
