The last time we checked in with PennTV, the rogue camera crew was loose in Providence, [grilling a very confused skateboarder](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/penn_explorers_venture_into_brown_wilderness.html) about love. Now the guys (a group we&#8217;re pretty sure exists, by the way; can&#8217;t find an official web page) have conquered Cambridge, polling Harvardians on the tameness of what little social scene there is. It&#8217;s highly enjoyable &#8212; though we have to say, [we&#8217;re not surprised](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/creepy_orwellian_trance_of_aleksey_vayner_fails_to_translate_into_fun.html).
