It&#8217;s about time we sat down and had a talk. About commenting.

We want to hear from you. That&#8217;s why we have a comments section. Call us dreamers, but at launch we pictured it as a place for Ivy smartasses to shine. But lately &#8230; well, maybe it&#8217;s best to point to this recent Churchillian battle of wits, from an item about a rap song:

Bravo, really. Do you guys intern at Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s dialogue shop?

Yeah, okay, this is the Internet, and that&#8217;s par for the anonymous course. And yeah, we ain&#8217;t writing Shakespeare ourselves, neither. (Please never visit our ghastly [July archives](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/).) But it kills us that a lot of people _are_ posting [awesome](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/wesleyan_fights_spam_with_spam_ivy_peg_below_promise.html#comment-5892) comments, and getting lost in a sea of &#8220;[ahahha](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/cornell_so_proud_of_itself_for_this.html#comment-5883) says: Cornell is the worst ivy hahaha, better than brown and dartmouth, hahahahahhaha.&#8221;

So: By all means, be tasteless, be destructive, be vitriolic. Tear our ill-argued screeds to shreds. Just don&#8217;t be [Fred](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/calling_aleksey_vayners_bluff.html#comment-2762).

For the record, we reserve the right to remove any comment that&#8217;s derogatory or patently offensive. (If you&#8217;re that uninspired, go [here](http://www.boredat.net/).) And we&#8217;re gonna try to comment more frequently ourselves, so it&#8217;s not just one-way yelling.

In conclusion, we&#8217;re not angry. Just disappointed. We&#8217;re die-hard behaviorists around here; we believe in positive reinforcement. That&#8217;s why we want to start giving brilliance its due with a new comments round-up at the end of every week. So go &#8212; sharpen your skewers, and prove those acceptance letters were deserved.
