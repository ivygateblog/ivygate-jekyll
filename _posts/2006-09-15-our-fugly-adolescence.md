Hey kiddo, turn off the TV for a sec, &#8216;kay? We want to have a talk.

Sometime between the ages of two and three months, a blog will change dramatically. This time is called puberty, and all blogs go through it, although each blog grows and changes at its own pace. When it happens, your blog may become larger, more frequently updated, Photoshopped to within an inch of its life, and kinda awkward. Your blog may feel full of energy or lie around and sleep a lot. Your moods may [shift](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/breaking_skorton_ice_cream_delicious.html) [uncontrollably](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/breaking_no_really_breaking_harvard_ends_early_admissions.html), surprising you and blogs around you.

OK, it&#8217;s dead. But seriously, we&#8217;re renovating around here, and we want to <span class="c1">beg for help</span> make a couple notes.

  1. Ads! Lookit them <span class="c2">shiny ads</span>, perched around the site like watchful angels, waiting to shower us with Cost Per Click revenue. [IvySport](http://www.ivysport.com/index-affiliate_id/75) led the way, and now [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ivygatheivyle-20&creative=380137&camp=212289&link_code=ur1&adid=1VWY1MWPPPB1BN8EAJ5M&path=tg/browse/-/465600) promises to keep you knee-deep in poorly sourced, navel-gazing gossip clear on through the semester.
  2. Code! Lookit that <span class="c2">crappy code</span>, and our garish design. Got HTML, PHP, Movable Type, or general design experience? [Help us](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com), if for no other reason than to save your classmates&#8217; retinas.
  3. Spend! Seriously. You can buy **all your t**<span class="c2">extbooks and video-gamery at</span> [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ivygatheivyle-20&creative=380137&camp=212289&link_code=ur1&adid=1VWY1MWPPPB1BN8EAJ5M&path=tg/browse/-/465600) by entering the site via links on our pages. That is, if you&#8217;re going to drop your parents&#8217; money there anyway, you might as well throw a buck or two in commission our way. We&#8217;ll think of you as we sing duets about lighting our tenement neighbor&#8217;s candle.

And most important, thanks for keeping the comments section robust. You are truly underchallenged. _Adelante!_
