The Ivy League is coming off a banner year ranked as the 24th best conference in the nation out of 30 (Take that, Atlantic Sun Conference!), and all indications point to another year of athletic mediocrity.

The season kicks off tonight at 7 p.m., when Brown will most certainly be destroyed by Michigan State.

But alas, NCAA rules stipulate that one of these teams has to win the conference and get throttled in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in March. We don&#8217;t know which team will win, but we have a good idea of why each team won&#8217;t.

Here, then, is our preview of the 2006-07 men&#8217;s basketball season, with teams listed from worst to slightly less worse:

8. **Why Dartmouth won&#8217;t win:** How much time do you have? Here&#8217;s one reason: the team is relying on some guy named Kurt Graeber. Never heard of him? Well, that&#8217;s because he transferred to Dartmouth this year from the athletic powerhouse Fullerton College (they aren&#8217;t even in the NCAA) &#8230; where he hardly saw a minute of playing time. It&#8217;s nice to know that one junior college&#8217;s table scraps is an Ivy League team&#8217;s star.

7. **Why Harvard won&#8217;t win:** Because they never have. The mediocrity tolerated in Harvard basketball is surpassed only by the mediocrity tolerated in academics at Cornell. Oh, and the team&#8217;s best player, Brian Cusworth, has only one semester of eligibility left. He decided to use that up in the first semester (when the team plays nonconference games that don&#8217;t matter) instead of in the second

6. **Why Brown won&#8217;t win:** Even the team&#8217;s star player, Keenan Jeppesen, doesn&#8217;t want to play at Brown. Jeppesen tried to transfer to Penn this summer and the Penn admissions department refused to review his application, saying that it would be unfair to the Brown basketball team and the overall competitive balance of the Ivy League. Karl Marx would be so proud.

5. **Why Yale won&#8217;t win:** Looks like top players don&#8217;t want to play for Bulldogs coach James Jones either. Nate Rohnert &#8212; the team&#8217;s top recruit &#8212; was expected to get a lot of minutes this year for the Elis. But after committing to attend Yale last winter, he decided to go to the University of Denver. Smartest move we&#8217;ve seen in a long time, buddy.
