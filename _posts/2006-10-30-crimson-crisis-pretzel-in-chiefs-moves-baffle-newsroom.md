The newsroom staff at 14 Plympton Street is agog this weekend over top editors&#8217; handling of what should have been a minor incident: a single [poorly sourced column](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/victoria_ilyinsky/). Now the campus is talking about the paper&#8217;s credibility, and the controversy is entirely of their own creation.

At 3 a.m. Friday, _Crimson_ president Will Marra &#8217;07 decided to pull a news story on columnist Victoria Ilyinsky&#8217;s firing from the print edition, and [posted it online](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515328) the following morning instead. Managing editor Dan Hemel &#8217;07 ran a blank space on page three in protest &#8212; the universal journalism symbol for &#8220;CENSORED,&#8221; and an unmistakably public Eff You to his boss.

Marra explained in an email to the news staff that he wanted to let the paper&#8217;s opinion editors have first dibs at addressing the flap with an editor&#8217;s note. &#8220;Holding off for a few hours with the story did not at all undermine news&#8217; credibility (and among our readers would have only increased it),&#8221; Marra wrote. But in what universe does withholding news _increase_ cred? In an effort to be hyper-ethical (or just cover his own ass), Marra&#8217;s bending over backward just became convoluted.

_Crimson_ bigshots flipped. Former managing editor Zach Seward (who covers Harvard for the _Wall Street Journal_) slammed Marra&#8217;s &#8220;extraordinarily cryptic&#8221; decisionmaking. &#8220;The Crimson was censored on Thursday night,&#8221; Seward wrote everyone. Sitting on hot news for arcane reasons of propriety, while the _Boston Globe_ and others wrote all about it, meant &#8220;the paper was, in perhaps a first, willfully scooped. To protect its own credibility? It&#8217;s like destroying the village in order to save it.&#8221; The rest of his blistering critique is after the jump, along with Hemel&#8217;s response. (Marra didn&#8217;t respond to our interview request; the author of the news story had no comment.)

We don&#8217;t have enough buckets to catch all the _Crimson_ leakage. Editors are pissed. Alumni are coming out of the woodwork with questions. Everyone agrees: Marra screwed up.&nbsp;

Does it get worse? Yup. History seemed to repeat itself this weekend when news staffers &#8211; remember blood in the water? &#8212; discovered that an editorial cartoon by Kathleen E. Breeden, &#8217;09, bore similarities to another cartoon published recently in _Newsday_. As with the Ilyinsky piece, CrimEds spent Sunday night waffling over publishing their news piece in the print edition vs. online. Last we heard, the story&#8217;s gonna be in the paper.

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- Forwarded message &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- From: Daniel Hemel Date: Oct 28, 2006 8:26 PM Subject: Re: \[NEWSTALK] Re: [CRIMEDS] A note on our Ilyinsky coverage To: Zachary Moses Seward Cc: Newstalk-l I understand that Will had a difficult decision to make Thursday night. I believe that he acted with the best of intentions. I continue to respect his leadership. I look forward to working with him for the next three months and beyond. That said, I believe he made a mistake Thursday night. By expressing my opinion, I hope to ensure that the future presidents on this e-mail chain avoid those same mistakes in the future. (1) Anton&#8217;s article was newsworthy, and it corrected misconceptions that readers might have had after reading the editors&#8217; note. The note did not answer several key questions. It does not explain when and how the Crimson learned about the similarities. Inasmuch as it describes the &#8220;investigation&#8221; of Ilyinsky, its statement is not entirely forthcoming: &#8220;Since the publication of that note, we have continued to investigate whether the piece properly cited all of its sources.&#8221; That sentence suggests that the ed board acted with &#8220;all deliberate speed&#8221; (Warren 1954, qtd. in Ogletree 2004). We were first informed about the similarities on Oct. 16 &#8211; through an e-mail to me from a Crimson reader. I forwarded that e-mail to the ed board immediately. It wasn&#8217;t until Oct. 23 that the ed board printed its first correction on the column&#8217;s attributions. And a full 12 days elapsed between the first allegations of plagiarism and the ed board&#8217;s final decision to cut the column. Moreover, the overlapping sportscaster&#8217;s quote, brought to the ed board&#8217;s attention on Oct. 24, was not uncovered by an ed board &#8220;investigation&#8221;; rather, news editor and magazine exec April Yee, using good reporting skills, identified the similarities. For all these reasons, I thought Anton&#8217;s factual account of the case added news value and merited placement in the print edition. (2) Will writes that he wanted to avoid &#8220;the impression that the news board had scooped the editorial board.&#8221; But the Boston Globe posted an article about the Crimson&#8217;s decision to its website Thursday night and printed the article Friday morning. Will&#8217;s decision did not prevent the news board from scooping the ed board. Rather, Will forced the news board into a position in which it would be scooped by the Boston Globe. And, of course, in a sense, the news board did actually scoop the ed board. It was the news/FM side of the paper that uncovered further evidence of copying &#8211; despite the ed board&#8217;s &#8220;investigation.&#8221; (3) I am most disturbed by Will&#8217;s characterization of himself as &#8220;the final editor of the news page.&#8221; This is certainly true in other cases, but Will had an irreconcilable conflict-of-interest on this issue; he was, indeed, a named principal in Anton&#8217;s story. As a news editor following well-established building-wide policy, Will should have recused himself from the handling of this story. May and I had both expressed our opinions on the handling of the matter &#8211; and if anyone would like to argue that we should have recused ourselves as well, I might agree. But we at least can plausibly argue that we made our judgments based on the content and relevance of the story-not based on a separate and conflicting interest. The president is above the managing editor in the Crimson&#8217;s decision-making process, but the president should never place himself above the Crimson&#8217;s commitment to objective reporting. By overriding our conflict-of-interest policies, Will did just that. Ultimately, we will go back to working together and put this incident behind us. I think that this open airing of views is a positive step in that direction. -Daniel.
