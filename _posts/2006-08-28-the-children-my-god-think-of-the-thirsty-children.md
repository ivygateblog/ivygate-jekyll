The real victims in the [&#8216;Stend-Razing of Aught-Six](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/the_west_end_history_wont_absolve_them.html), of course, are the kiddies in the Class of 2010. With the bar shuttered for orientation and [Shiva](http://www.ivygateblog.com/blog-mt/sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/shiva.htm) knows how much longer, there&#8217;s a distinct possibility the class never properly [imprints](http://www.ivygateblog.com/blog-mt/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)) an attachment with 2911 Broadway.

The West End was many things to many people. Mere pitcher-and-wings spot to some, mighty historical landmark (&#8220;Kerouac wuz here&#8221;) to most, Rohypnol HQ to pretty much everyone &#8230; we always made a point of stopping by whenever visiting the Unhappiest Ivy. Not to make too much of its [Cubanification](http://media.www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/04/10/News/Rethinking.The.stend-2027607.shtml?sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) &#8212; when the dropcloths come off, we admit, the new owners may actually have just cleaned up the place &#8212; but the place really was that special. To wit:

> One time I went up to the bouncer with the fakest ID in North America. It was a student ID for Fordham, and the only remotely official looking element was its lamination. The bouncer said, &#8220;Where is Fordham&#8221; and I replied, &#8220;I have no idea.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Next time you should know. It&#8217;s in the Bronx.&#8221; And he let me in. He later threw me out when I puked in a booth.

>   My friend, Marty Bresnick, and I were preparing for a mid-term exam the next day in one of Professor Morganbesser&#8217;s philosophy courses. Finding the sedate atmosphere of Butler Library too distracting for studying, we went to the West End. Being young, adventuresome or just foolish and overcome by hunger, I made the mistake of sampling the West End&#8217;s fare and paid for it. The next day, I managed to make it to Professor Morgenbesser&#8217;s class, but just as the exam was beginning, I was overcome by nausea and threw up in my blue book. Having established this visceral connection with Philosophy, I went on to major in it.

>   Once, when I asked for a Magic Hat, a pretty mainstream beer, the bartender looked at me like I was nuts. &#8220;You from Maine or something?&#8221; he asked. Another time, I returned a drink because the pineapple mix in my vodka-pineapple had gone bad, and the same bartender asked me the same question. I never understood what he meant.

>   I can&#8217;t pick which memory I find funnier. Maybe it&#8217;s the time I broke my flip-flops there on my 21st birthday. The floor was so sticky that when I went to lift up my foot, the bottom of my shoe stuck to floor and the top part just broke off and I had to drunkenly hobble home. Or the Sunday brunch when I discovered they hadn&#8217;t removed the plastic from the cheese they put into my omelette. Above all I think it&#8217;d have to be that my very first time in a bar was at the West End, during orientation my first year. I&#8217;ll never forget when a staff member stood up and screamed, &#8220;Call your parents, tell them you need money for books, and go and buy a fake ID in Times Square. We don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s fake, you just need to show us an ID!&#8221;

>   The night before commencement, I went to the West End with a few friends to celebrate and racked up a triple-digit bar tab and forgot to get my credit card before I left. The next day, after commencement ceremonies, I went to the West End for lunch with my extended family. I-Max, the bartender, came up to our table and announced to my whole family how much I&#8217;d forgotten to pay last night, but then told me it was on the house because I was such a good customer throughout the years. So my family finally found out what their tuition dollars were for.

>   July 13, 1977&#8211;The West End was already half-full of people seeking relief from a stifling summer night. Then the lights went out and stayed out until the next afternoon. Outside, sirens wailed and gangs prowled, smashing windows, looting. Inside, with coolers, cash registers, jukeboxes and A/C all out of commission, the bar staff served up room temperature beer by candlelight. The crowds poured in and stayed until all the beer was drunk. Then we made our way home through the dark, steaming streets, young enough to thrill to the sharp scent of menace in the humid air.
