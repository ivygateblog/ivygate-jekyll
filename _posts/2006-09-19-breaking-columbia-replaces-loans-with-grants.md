Now Columbia [eliminates](http://media.www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/09/19/News/Cu.Trades.Loans.For.Grants-2284572.shtml?sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) loans for students from families that earn less than $50,000 a year (eating Harvard, Penn, Yale and Stanford&#8217;s collective dust). Where does the admirable, praiseworthy madness end?! Next thing we know, Harvard will be&nbsp;donating its endowment, Buffett-style, to end world poverty.

Of course, Princeton still beats them all with its grants-only aid package royale. We might need to update our [Ivy stereotypes manifesto](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/do_you_know_who_youre_dealing.html) &#8230;
