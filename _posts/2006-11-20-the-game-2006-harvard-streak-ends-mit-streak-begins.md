We were dreading having to write a sleepy, dead-on-arrival item about [The Game](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/the_game/): Yale won, Harvard lost, a streak ended, yadda yadda yadda. Thank God, then, that MIT &#8212; The Game&#8217;s frequent [disruptor](http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/1990/H-Y/H-Y.html) &#8212; gave us an angle on this yawn-fest. And as usual, that angle is nudity.

Streakers! God bless &#8217;em. Late in the fourth quarter, the letters of his school writ large across his back, one brave MIT stallion wove around policemen, stadium security, and indifferent football players before being brought down near the Yale 40 yard line. His partner, perhaps imitating the Crimson offense, was brought down before he got going, cuffed near the edge of the field. If that guy&#8217;s smug grin is any sign, he&#8217;s getting a hero&#8217;s welcome back home. Maybe he&#8217;ll even get a new pair of socks.
