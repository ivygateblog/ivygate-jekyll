A military veteran taking classes at UPenn was shot to death early this morning, the DP is [reporting](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/08/31/44f7537c33994) and a university spokesman told IvyGate. L&#8217;Salle Harvey was affiliated with [Veterans Upward Bound](http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/dasp/veteransUpwardBound_home.html), a program that provides free college prep courses; the shooting occurred far from campus, and the university knows only what it&#8217;s reading in the DP, spokesman Ron Ozio said. Calls to program officers&#8217; homes were not answered.
