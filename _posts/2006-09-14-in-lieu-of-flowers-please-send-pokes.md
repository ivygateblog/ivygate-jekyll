The lights are up; the DJ&#8217;s playing &#8220;Closing Time&#8221;; you&#8217;re going home alone again.

With word circulating that Facebook is [expanding to the great unwashed](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514193), Mark Zuckerberg greets users today with yet another open letter. &#8220;Honestly, it shouldn&#8217;t change much for you,&#8221; he pleads. (Do you think Mark lies awake at night in his Silicon Valley bachelor pad, composing these in his head?&nbsp; Or does he just play a lot of HALO?)

Maybe it will, maybe it won&#8217;t; the point is that Facebook as _we_ know it is dead or dying. We&#8217;ve no doubt that the corporation will actually get bigger and more profitable by expanding &#8212; but it&#8217;ll feel like a different site. The first (only?) generation of users is already souring, and we, for one, will be humming &#8220;Send in the Clowns&#8221; as our personal use of the place eventually wanes to zero.

Goodbye, sweet Facebook. You were too beautiful for this world.
