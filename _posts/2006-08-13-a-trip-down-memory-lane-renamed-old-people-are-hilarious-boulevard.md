<img width="200" hspace="5" height="305" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/scaling-the-ivy-wall.jpg" alt="A Trip Down Memory Lane, Renamed &quot;Old People Are Hilarious Boulevard&quot;" />What a lovely afternoon! Birds are chirping, children are laughing, and look, here&#8217;s a stoop sale with books! What shall we buy? _The Client_? Too long. _Best Lesbian Erotica_? We&#8217;ve had better. Look no further: _Scaling the Ivy Wall: Getting Into the Selective Colleges_ (&copy; 1975), and it&#8217;s only a dollar!*

Truly, it is an artifact. What kind of car is a &#8220;flivver&#8221;? Who or what is Bennington? A telling passage:

> Despite the fact that it will cost over $6,000 a year at most selective colleges, the applications continue to pour in. Obviously, whatever Harvard or Vassar _[Ed. note: ???????]_ costs, it seems worth the sacrifice.

As you might expect, the most entertaining reading is about &#8220;The Changing Campus.&#8221; After noting, bizarrely, that hitchhiking is a complete necessity on every college campus, the authors turn to the brave new world of sex:&nbsp;

> Take co-ed dormitories. Girls and boys live on separate floors, or in separate entries. But then an affair begins, and a suite that is male or female becomes de facto co-ed. Cohabitation, they call it, and there is no word for the distress this situation can cause impressionable roommates.

Not even the realization that the class of &#8217;75 included a lot of our parents can make that less amusing.
