If you&#8217;re like us, you&#8217;re aware that the Ivy League has something called &#8220;crew,&#8221; and that it has something to do with muscled anorexics sitting in a boat, rowing in unison when a smaller anorexic with a funny name tells them to. So this video from Sunday&#8217;s Princeton Chase event pretty much encapsulates our view of the sport: It&#8217;s long, it&#8217;s confusing, and people we don&#8217;t really know or see are passionate about it. You can find out what actually happened to Columbia&#8217;s heavyweight &#8220;A&#8221; squad [here](http://www.gocolumbialions.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9600&ATCLID=660707), or you can just watch in simple, happy ignorance.
