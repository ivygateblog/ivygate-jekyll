      With football season just around the corner, Harvard is doing what it does best: making everyone else feel poor. Their stadium will get a <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512722">$5 million upgrade</a>, including a futuristic synthetic playing surface and lights on the stadium&#8217;s exterior. They&#8217;re also installing a seasonal &#8220;bubble&#8221; to protect willowy Harvardians from the mean ol&#8217; wind. (Though it won&#8217;t keep out <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/deadspin_likes_us_it_really_likes_us_1.html">these guys</a>.)

        Up in Dartmouth Country, they&#8217;re laying <a href="http://athletics.dartmouth.edu/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/082206aac.html">new turf</a> on Memorial Field. Congrats, guys! Only a few weight room renovations and a new field house to go until respectability.

          Columbia is trying to keep up, but as usual they&#8217;re being &#8230; frugal. Apparently unable to hire a handyman, the school declared &#8220;Pride Day&#8221; and &#8212; Lord, that we were making this up &#8212; <a href="http://www.gocolumbialions.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=43682&SPID=3888&DB_OEM_ID=9600&ATCLID=575299">had the soccer teams reseed the field themselves</a>.

            Now, before any of the commenters get clucking about how much money is spent on athletics, I feel obligated to note a little something down in Texas called <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=ncf&id=2562114">The Godzillatron</a>. When Penn installs the largest high-definition video screen on planet Earth (&#8220;nearly as wide as the field itself&#8221;) at Franklin Field, then you&#8217;re allowed to complain.
