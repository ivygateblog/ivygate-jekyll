<img width="312" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="403" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/whimnrhytm.gif" alt="Yale Alumna Double-Crosses Golden-Throated Innocents (UPDATED)" />Imagine you&#8217;re a member of a female a cappella group from Yale. (Bear with us.) You&#8217;re on tour in L.A. You show up for a gig organized by HBO sex host and Yale alumna Susan M. Block, where you sign mysterious, Borat-like release forms. After the concert, your hostess serves drinks and asks you to dress up in weirdly revealing period costumes and pose for a camera. At this point, our sketch-dar would have been overheating. Unfortunately for Yale&#8217;s [Whim &#8216;n Rhythm](http://www.yale.edu/whim/), all this didn&#8217;t quite register &#8212; or if it did, they didn&#8217;t want to insult their hostess.

And now there&#8217;s a DVD.

It&#8217;s pitched on Block&#8217;s [website](http://www.drsusanblock.com/yalewhim/) as a sort of caught-on-camera &#8220;Yalies Gone Wild&#8221; that&#8217;s somehow also &#8220;hilarious and heart-warming.&#8221; We hear the video may or may not contain full frontal nudity involving a Whiffenpoof. (If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t ask.)

Needless to say, the Whim&#8217;n are miffed. And rightly so: Block was clearly dishonest (although, to be fair, it _was_ a sex palace). She&#8217;s even been peddling the DVD on the Yale Alumni Magazine&#8217;s website. So far the group has been unable to get their names removed from Block&#8217;s site. (We&#8217;re trying to keep everyone un-Googleable, but just know it features the stunning Ickieray Udeautray, aughterday of Arrygay). But before you feel _too_ bad for the ladies, consider that they don&#8217;t see a problem with pocketing 30 percent of the DVD&#8217;s revenues. Whether that&#8217;s hush money or not depends on your definition of the term; either way, expect some spicy confirmation hearings 40 years from now.

Anyway, we don&#8217;t expect much repentance from the woman who brought us the seminal film &#8220;Dr. Susan Block&#8217;s Squirt Salon.&#8221; If it makes the Whim&#8217;n feel any better, they&#8217;re astonishingly good. Here&#8217;s hard video proof (beware sudden cutaways to Block&#8217;s face):

**UPDATE 10:48 p.m.:** Just when we were looking forward to never wasting bandwidth on Susan Block again, a reader informs us that, as usual, Yale&#8217;s _Rumpus_ did it first and did it better. In 2005, Jon Carlo Bruttomesso penned an account of his traumatic interview/photoshoot with Dr. Block and her merry band. The original version of the piece supposedly contained passage too scarring even for _Rumpus_&#8216;s jaded readership, so they toned it down to merely horrific. [Read](http://www.ivygateblog.com/images/rumpusblock.pdf) it at your own discretion (PDF).
