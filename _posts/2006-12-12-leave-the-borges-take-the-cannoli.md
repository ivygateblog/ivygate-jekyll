Harvard Square&#8217;s Lame Duck Books store caused an uproar Monday when the <span class="c2">Crimson</span> reported it had [lost two irreplaceable Jorge Luis Borges manuscripts](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=516324) worth almost $1 million. But the store, and the international literary community, unclenched its collective buttocks just as quickly yesterday when Lame Duck owner John Wronoski announced that [the precious documents were in the store all along](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=516348) &#8212; &#8220;accidentally&#8221; hidden in the sleeve of a photo binder.

<p class="c3">
  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t get more surreal than that. This is like a Borges short story,&#8221; [employee Sa&uacute;l] Roll said about the fact that the manuscript was found on the day the <span class="c2">Crimson</span> story was published.
</p>

<p class="c3">
  Assistant Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures Mariano Siskind, whose specialities include 20th century Latin American literature, said Borges would have liked the mystery surrounding the manuscripts&#8217; disappearance.

About that &#8220;mystery&#8221;: Call us crazy, but Encyclopedia Brown might call this The Case of the Scary Gangster Motherfucker Pictured Above. He&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s fair to say, your average bookworm. Look, for all we know that guy <span class="c2">is</span> John Wronoski, but given that A) his skull is shinier than his leather jacket and B) we&#8217;re scared to death of his I&#8217;ll-Kill-You stare, we&#8217;re pretty sure he&#8217;s the muscle, and that somewhere in Cambridge is a sticky-fingered lit major with two broken kneecaps.

(Also, what is that guy in the background doing? Maybe trying to pull a [vise](http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,867652,00.html) off his head?)
