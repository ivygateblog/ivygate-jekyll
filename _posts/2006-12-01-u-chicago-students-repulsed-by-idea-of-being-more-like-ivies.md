Chicago Students Repulsed By Idea of Being More Like Ivies" />Students at the University of Chicago are furious with the school for considering a switch from its beloved &#8220;Uncommon Application&#8221; (sample question: give a definition of your &#8220;[he&#8217;lade](http://the-editors.blogspot.com/2006/07/this-years-uncommon-application-essay.html),&#8221; or &#8220;Place Having Everything Right,&#8221; relating to the Kwakiutl tribe of British Columbia) to the humorless, Soviet-reminiscent Common Application, that generic form you can fill out once and mail to 298 schools.

It&#8217;s a complicated issue, balancing school character and tradition with the need to remain competitive with other elite universities in today&#8217;s hypercharged admissions climate. But the U of C kids are waging their side of the battle with [pure Ivy-trashing abandon](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/12/01/chicago), so naturally we side with them.

> If students are going to attend a rigorous institution, the students say, they should be able to handle a rigorous application.&nbsp; &#8220;If you are smart and don&#8217;t want to work hard, then go to Harvard, or better yet, go to Brown,&#8221; said Roger Fierro, a senior who is chair of the Prospective Students Advisory Committee. &#8230;

> &#8220;I cannot express how much the Uncommon Application meant to me during the soul-destroying ordeal of the college application process. Please don&#8217;t let our goddamn Ivy League penis envy force a move that would infinitely diminish the school in the eyes of current and future students,&#8221; wrote one student. &#8230;

> In an editorial called &#8220;Who Wants to Go to UPenn, Anyway?,&#8221; the student newspaper, the Chicago Maroon, wrote that the students fighting the change feared that the university could become a &#8220;generic elite private university.&#8221; &#8230;

Long live the Uncommon App! More Ivy slurs! Crescat scientia; vita excolatur!
