<div>
  But Ivy League athletes have gone out of their way to act like their Big Ten and SEC counterparts this season. Here&#8217;s just a short list of their indiscretions:&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Harvard&#8217;s captain, middle linebacker Matthew Thomas, is in anger-management classes and alcohol rehab after <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/harvard_football_team_down_to_just_kicker_waterboy.html">allegedly&nbsp;</a>breaking through the door of a former girlfriend&#8217;s room and attacking her.
    </li>
    <li>
      Harvard backup receiver Keegan Toci was <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/varsity_blues_showdown_erupts_at_harvard.html">thrown off the team</a> after what coach Tim Murphy called a &#8220;disgusting&#8221; performance in the team&#8217;s annual skit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dartmouth&#8217;s entire football team had a <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/dartmouths_18_percent_doctrine_1.html">bench-clearing brawl</a> against Holy Cross.
    </li>
    <li>
      The likely Player of the Year, Yale running back&nbsp;Mike McLeod, was arrested in October after he, along with quarterback Matt Polhemus, got in a fight with a couple of Yale hockey players.
    </li>
  </ul>

  It seems the nation has taken notice &#8212; <em>The New York Times</em> in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/sports/ncaafootball/21ivy.html?ei=5088&en=a1ed8c968a14885d&ex=1319083200&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1163707365-gVNGVku7EhtTS+iQ5hhRRg">October</a>, and now <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/lester_munson/11/14/harvard.yale/">Sports Illustrated</a>. Columnist Lester Munson notes that while Harvard has put its&nbsp;foot down and suspended players this season, Yale has let its bad seeds continue to play:
</div>

> <div>
>   And so there will be a whole new vocabulary for the elite at The Game. They&#8217;ll find themselves tossing around words like rehab, community service, probation, suspension, criminal mischief, breach of peace, breaking and entering, assault and criminal damage to property. And they&#8217;ll wonder about the different approaches at Harvard and at Yale to violence among their student-athletes and the importance of winning The Game.

<div>
  Ratcheting up the melodrama, Munson even suggests that former Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett (recently sentenced to 7.5 years in prison) and a former Nebraska running back (recently found guilty of seven counts of assault with a deadly weapon) should have thought about going to Yale when making college plans. Honestly? We&#8217;re completely in favor of that.
