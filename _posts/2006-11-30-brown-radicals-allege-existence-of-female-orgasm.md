_<img vspace="10" hspace="10" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/harrymetsally.jpg" alt="Brown Radicals Allege Existence of Female Orgasm" />__Our friend, the lovely Ms. IvyGate, files this wholesome_ _report on a recent seminar at Brown:_

There are certain things Ivy ladies can do just as well as Ivy gentlemen. Not math, of course. Turns out, despite what you&#8217;ve nearly convinced your girlfriend, we women can orgasm.

We know there&#8217;s no evolutionarily significant reason for this, but there you have it. And now there are some 30 boys at Brown who wield this dangerous knowledge. They&#8217;ve observed &#8212; and may have fondled &#8212; a vagina-puppet. And they took notes.

It&#8217;s all part of a radical feminist agenda that brought Planned Parenthood counselor Megan Andelloux &#8212; you may remember her from such educational workshops as &#8220;Back Door Lovin'&#8221; &#8212; to Brown this month to [give a seminar](http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/11/29/Features/OnCampus.Female.Orgasm.Workshop.Draws.Curious.Males-2511873.shtml?sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) on this mysterious and elusive female orgasm. She knew her audience, too; or rather, her audience knew her, since she&#8217;s also a gyno model (her words) at both Yale and Brown, allowing Ivy pre-meds to &#8220;use her body to practice their first, or 20th pelvic, anal, breast and vaginal ultrasound exams.&#8221;

In this case, Veronica the vagina-puppet did most of the work, and early reports suggest that squirming was minimal (until the video screening of elderly women massaging themselves). One obviously very secure male participant insisted to a _Brown Daily Herald_ reporter that &#8220;it takes a real man to come out and say, &#8216;No, I don&#8217;t know everything about this.'&#8221; We have to agree, buddy. Man up and go down &#8212; especially now that your name, and those of the nine other guys quoted in the piece, is now Google-able with the phrase &#8220;Ben Wa balls.&#8221;

The _Herald_&#8216;s account of the meeting gives tantalizing hints of myths dispelled and oral sex faux pas corrected, but alas, in the end it&#8217;s just a &#8216;tease. As a public service, we offer Ms. Andelloux&#8217;s workshop handout. And they say Columbia is the [Ivy Gone Wild](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/ny_daily_news_expose_blows_lid_off_columbias_hardcore_curriculum.html).
