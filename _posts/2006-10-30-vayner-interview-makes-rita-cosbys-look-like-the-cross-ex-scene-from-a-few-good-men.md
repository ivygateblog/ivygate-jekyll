Too bad they left their spine on the mantelpiece next to their keys that day. Here&#8217;s a snippet:

> **YH:** _One endeavor your r&eacute;sum&eacute; mentions is Vayner Capital Management, a business that you reportedly created. Could you describe this business?_
> 
> **AV:** We&#8217;re a limited liability corporation, based in New York.
> 
> **YH:** _Is that all you can say about it on the record?_
> 
> **AV:** Yes.

Now that, folks, is what we call a follow-up question. The piece is so hard-hitting the byline is blank; no one on staff seems to want to take credit for it. Keep on sluggin&#8217;, guys.
