(Ivy Peg Below, Promise)" />College students can expect to get e-mails from university administrators &#8212; that&#8217;s why God invented the Gmail &#8220;report spam&#8221; button. But what administration spams students _at another school_? Brown&#8217;s, apparently.

Wesleyan students have reportedly been inundated with e-mails from Brown asking them to fill out surveys on academic advising. (It&#8217;s pasted after the jump.) &#8220;Not altogether bad, sort of interesting, in any case they mean well,&#8221; one Wesleyan student told us. &#8220;But anyways, the problem is that they don&#8217;t&#8230;stop&#8230;e-mailing you, even if you ask to be taken off their mailing list, no matter if you contact the person at <span class="st">brown</span> or the wes[leyan] originator.&#8221;

Why and how Brown officials got access to Wesleyan listservs, we have no idea. But some students are fighting back. Fun group blog [Wesleying](http://wesleying.blogspot.com/) posted one student&#8217;s [blueprint for rebellion](http://wesleying.blogspot.com/2006/11/go-away-brown.html):

> I already asked to be taken off the list politely, but today I just got a second email. So I have sent their point of contact, a class dean who&#8217;s email address is robert_shaw@brown.edu a 4MB image of the ct bylaws guiding unsolicited email (along with the link). I encourage all of you to do the same (or send other large attachments to him, like setup files, long poetry, your thesis).

A Wesleyan dean has apparently called the student, asking him to stop exhorting other students to spam Brown. On the off chance that he has stopped, we&#8217;ll gladly take up the cause. Brown&#8217;s IT guys can pretty easily block that four-megabyte attachment, so let&#8217;s kill Mr. Shaw&#8217;s inbox with a thousand cuts, shall we? Treat him to your more elaborate theses, complex Excel models, high-res art portfolios, etc., at&nbsp;<robert_shaw@brown.edu>.&nbsp;Help end mass administrative e-mails for all&nbsp;time.
