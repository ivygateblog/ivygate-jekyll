Can someone please get this man a sitcom?

Clearly, Aleksey Vayner deserves it. In the four days since we (_cough_ exclusively! _cough_) posted [the video](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/how_not_to_apply_for_a_job_in_ibanking.html) the Yale senior commissioned of himself and attached to some i-banking applications, dozens of people have shared their Aleksey stories with us. And more often than not, they&#8217;re stories _he_ told _them_ &#8212; which is why we don&#8217;t feel bad about [all the attention](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/aleksey_vayner/) we&#8217;re heaping on this fabulist. ([Fake business, fake charity, fake book](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/lord_of_the_lies_aleksey_vayner_outdoes_himself.html) &#8212; sympathy kinda evaporates, don&#8217;t it?)

All day long, the tips kept getting better. We can only share a few here &#8212; but we suspect this spring will never run dry.

  * The [writing sample](http://www.ivygateblog.com/images/vayner.pdf) Aleksey attached to his i-bank applications appears to be at least partially plagiarized from [this source](http://singapore.pimco.com/LeftNav/Viewpoints/2005/Alpha+Beta+May+2005.htm) (which, weirdly, he quotes earlier in the piece). Search on &#8220;hidden beta exposure&#8221; in both articles. 
  * A member of the Yale tennis team [wrote in](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/lord_of_the_lies_aleksey_vayner_outdoes_himself.html#comment-1201) to dispute Aleksey&#8217;s claim that he competed on the Satellite tour: &#8220;I played for Yale tennis, and he tried to walk on the team. He got cut the second day. I had one conversation with him, and he claimed to have KILLED 24 people in the caves of Tibet.&#8221; 
    (Other great comments: &#8220;I too played for Yale tennis, and Vayner/Garber claimed that he has trouble flying on planes because he has to register his hands as lethal weapons each time he goes to an airport.&#8221;&nbsp; And: &#8220;The giveaway on the investment firm was that he said his firm specialized in &#8220;risk-aDverse&#8221; strategies. The other giveaway was that he&#8217;s fucking crazy.&#8221;)

  * We decided to not be too scared of the [cease and desist letter](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/well_be_sure_to_show_this_to_our_lawyers_when_theyre_out_of_class.html) Aleksey emailed us, given that he [copied and pasted it](http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/INTELLECTUALPROPERTY/contract/cease.htm) from the first Google hit for &#8220;cease and desist letter,&#8221; right down to the &#8220;very truly yours&#8221; signoff. Attorney Ron706@aol.com, Esq., really earned his fee there. 
  * At Yale, Aleksey has offered to treat sports injuries using various &#8220;Eastern&#8221; therapy methods, including massage and acupuncture. Before &#8220;treating&#8221; a &#8220;patient,&#8221; he sent them [this letter](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/lord_of_the_lies_aleksey_vayner_outdoes_himself.html#comment-1221). You simply have to read it in full. Somewhere in there he claims that his brother is &#8220;head of pediatrics at Columbian Presbyterian hospital in NYC.&#8221; A search on the Columbia Presbyterian Physician Network turns up no one with the last name &#8220;Garber&#8221; or &#8220;Vayner.&#8221; But our favorite part is this line: &#8220;I am not certified in any Western sense of the word, neither in Chinese medicine, Tui-Na, Shaolin trauma medicine, nor in acupuncture, all of which I practice extensively never-the-less.&#8221; 
  * And, um, not quite so humorously, the SEC and dean of Yale College have been notified of Aleksey&#8217;s transgressions.

God, what theater. You cannot make this shit up. Unless, y&#8217;know, you&#8217;re Aleksey.

**Bonus:** _The Yale Daily News_ [joins the fracas](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=33628). Money line: &#8220;<span class="ArticleText">Among the claims [a dance teammate] said she has heard is one that Vayner is one of four people in the state of Connecticut qualified to handle nuclear waste.</span>&#8220;
