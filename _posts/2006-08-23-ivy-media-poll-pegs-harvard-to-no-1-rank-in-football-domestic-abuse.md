  The 2006 <a href="http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/article.asp?intID=5351">Ivy Football Media Poll</a> was released the other week, and surprise! Harvard is the early favorite, with Penn right on its heels.
</p>

<p class="c1">
  The Crimson top the list with 116 votes (nine first-place), but more people are talking about what&#8217;s happening off the field in Cambridge, namely the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513898">suspension of captain Matt Thomas</a> &#8212; the third member of the team to receive a suspension in two months. Go Cantabs!
</p>

  Penn clocks in second, despite finishing under .500 last season, while defending champ Brown places third now that Ivy Player of the Year Nick Hartigan has graduated. Cornell and its up-and-coming coach, Jim Knowles, are No. 4.

  In the cellar: Dartmouth (No. 7) fans may not get many wins this year, but should at least look forward to a <a href="http://biggreenalertblog.blogspot.com/">renovated stadium</a>. Columbia (No. 8, like we needed to tell you that) should just start drinking now. The Lions were two votes away from a unanimous last-place selection, their case not helped by new head coach Norries Wilson&#8217;s plan to run a 3-5-3 defense. Hey Coach, Columbia couldn&#8217;t stop the run with five down linemen at times last year &#8212; forget about four, or (shudder) three.
