You know those useless but entertaining [online translation programs](http://www.google.com/translate_t)? We&#8217;re starting to think the WB is like one of those, except for life. With the right combination of jump cuts, reverse video, Jimmy Eat World, and splashy cut-out freeze frames, they could make a Senate confirmation hearing look like an episode of Room Raiders.

So you can guess what happens when the WB decides to start <strike>producing</strike> hosting college tour videos. Behold [theU](http://www.theu.com), the cinematic lovechild that would emerge if Mischa Barton had relations with a Princeton Review handbook. TheU&#8217;s founder, 25-year-old Columbia <strike>pseudo-</strike>alum Doug Imbruce, says he got the got the idea while watching &#8220;MTV Cribs.&#8221; It shows. Here&#8217;s theU&#8217;s narrator on Brown University: &#8220;Brown is like the token cool mom of the Ivy Leagues.&#8221; Or her thoughts on the World&#8217;s Greatest University: &#8220;Harvard won&#8217;t reveal its selection criteria, but it&#8217;s clear that talent, ambition, and genius are key.&#8221; They even have the lovable Penn frat boy, caught on camera in his natural habitat: &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember Spring Fling. I&#8217;ve been told I had a really good time. I had relations with a tree. It might have been an elm, might have been a cedar. I don&#8217;t really know.&#8221;

There are some inspired moments, like when a narrator [points out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l30JgClam0I) that &#8220;Princeton definitely isn&#8217;t a crazy hookup scene&#8221; as we watch boys and girls juggling pins on a lawn. We know TheU means well. Of course, it also means to do well, by making shit-tons of money off terrified, TV-happy high-schoolers for whom an endorsement from &#8220;Everwood&#8221;s Chris Pratt seals Brown as their first choice.
