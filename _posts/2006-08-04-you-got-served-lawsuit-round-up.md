And like us, you didn&#8217;t fight back. You let the punches fall, vowing to one day rain down furious vengeance upon those who crossed you. Well, that day has come! &#8230; and you&#8217;re still the same gangly twerp as before, maybe with a droopy chest hair or two. So what do you do? Brush it off? Let your rage sublimate into positive energy? Heeey-el naw!! Take the bastards to court!&nbsp;

In that spirit, we bring you the most recent batch of lawsuits filed by and against our Ivy compatriots. (All Yalies, oddly. Bitter much?)
  
&nbsp;

&#8211; **The spat:** Rejected grad school applicant sues Yale for [discrimination](http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-ctyalesuit0803.artaug03,0,7932378.story?coll=hc-headlines-local), claiming the university turned her down because of her age and poor health.&nbsp; The plaintiff, Elizabeth Ruggiero, is 44 years old and has multiple sclerosis.

&#8211; **Our verdict:** Seriously? Have you ever sat through a college lecture? There&#8217;s _gotta_ be affirmative action for palsied old men who shout answers from the front row.

&#8211; **The spat:** Paramount [sues](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/02/AR2006080201638.html) Yale film student for shooting a 12-minute segment from Oliver Stone&#8217;s leaked &#8220;World Trade Center&#8221; script as his master&#8217;s thesis.

&#8211; **Our verdict:** We hereby find Paramount execs to be boxes of tools. They ordered the student to [remove](http://www.pointsofdeparture.net/) his video from YouTube for fear that viewers would confuse it with the real movie. I&#8217;m sorry, if you&#8217;re afraid audiences can&#8217;t differentiate between your $60 million Nic Cage vehicle and an artsy student film, copyright infringement is the least of your problems.

&#8211; **The spat:** In 1912, Yale archaeologist Hiram Bingham III made off with some artifacts from Machu Picchu, promising to return them after 18 months. Sike! A century later, Yale [still has the statues](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=32634) and Peru&nbsp; is pissed. (No lawsuit yet. At this rate, what&#8217;s another hundred years?)

&#8211; **Our verdict:** Sorry, Peru. If decades-old international [treaties](http://www.ivygateblog.com/blog-mt/) can&#8217;t stop [Harvard alums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Gonzales) from giving terror suspects the [Spanish donkey](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Spanish+Donkey), century-old pinky swears definitely won&#8217;t move these stubborn Yalies.
