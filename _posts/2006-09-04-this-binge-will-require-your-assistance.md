Morgan Stanley made you that offer; you squeezed every last kilometer out of that Eurail pass; and as for Johnny Castle &#8212; you&#8217;ll never see him again, but O&nbsp;summer love it was worth it.

It&#8217;s all over now as Brown, Columbia, Penn and Yale trudge back to class this week, tan, rested,&nbsp;and still a little high. As for us, we spent our summer&nbsp;watching&nbsp;_Rocky_ training montages on YouTube, shadowboxing and committing Ivy class presidents to memory.

Check in with us tomorrow at the crack of 10, when we kick things off in style. Probably by desperately begging you for tips. We crave information, people, and the gossip here is only as good as what you leak us. Email <IvyGate@gmail.com>! IM [ivygateblog](aim:goim?screenname=ivygateblog)! We have, as this test run should have made abundantly clear, <strike>pretty low</strike> no standards.
