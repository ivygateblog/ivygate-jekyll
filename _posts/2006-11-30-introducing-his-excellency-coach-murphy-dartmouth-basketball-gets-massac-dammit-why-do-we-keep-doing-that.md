<img width="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="300" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/area51.jpg" alt="Introducing His Excellency Coach Murphy; Dartmouth Basketball Gets Massac -- Dammit, Why Do We Keep Doing That?" />Despite having pointed out that Dartmouth is [the worst team in college basketball](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/penn_fans_angered_by_lowscoring_9774_win.html), we noted with disapproval the suckers-only 35.5 point line assigned to a recent game at No. 5 Kansas. C&#8217;mon, Las Vegas &#8212; that&#8217;s just mean. That&#8217;s a punchline, not a point spread. Shame on you.

Um. The Big Green managed to outdo itself, [losing by 51](http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/basketball/wire/sns-ap-bkc-t25-dartmouth-kansas,1,7585189.story?coll=sns-ap-collegebb-headlines). As the AP lede notes,

> Teams have been coming into Allen Fieldhouse to play Kansas for more than half a century. Every one of them managed to score more points than helplessly outmanned Dartmouth Tuesday night.

At least no [Native Americans](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/upset_dartmouth_athletics_director_is_on_the_warpa_wait_bad_idea.html) were offended, though. That should definitely remain the Dartmouth Athletic Department&#8217;s No. 1 priority.

**Also in embarrassing Ivy sports news:** [Power-mad](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/varsity_blues_showdown_erupts_at_harvard.html) Harvard football coach Tim Murphy was re-signed through the 2011 season on Monday &#8212; except he wasn&#8217;t. According to Harvard Athletic Communications, Murphy was &#8212; anyone else&#8217;s acid reflux acting up? &#8212; &#8220;[reappointed](http://www.gocrimson.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9000&ATCLID=696579).&#8221; Only in the Ivy League.

We don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s worse, the fact that Harvard is trying to use a word that equates Murphy&#8217;s job (for which he gets paid more than $100,000 a year to coach 10 meaningless games) with that of a dean or department chair, or the fact that the [_Crimson_](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=516001) and [Associated Press](http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stories/112706acs.html) both took the bait. If he&#8217;s King Murphy, does that make you his serfs?
