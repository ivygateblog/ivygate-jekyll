[<img width="320" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="175" border="0" align="right" title="The 2006 Weblog Awards" alt="The 2006 Weblog Awards" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/2006finalist300ku1.jpg" />](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_educational_blog.php)_Finally_ &#8212; some recognition for the Ivy League.

We found out yesterday that IvyGate, for reasons that are not quite clear, is up for &#8220;Best Educational Blog&#8221; in the 2006 Weblog Awards. Aw shucks, false modesty, etc: Honestly, we&#8217;re pretty happy, and we have to give all credit to you guys (specifically, your keeping the [inbox](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com) chin-deep in gossip).

The other finalists actually, um, appear interested in pedagogy and helping people, but nevertheless we intend to mop the floor with them. May God save [Eduwonk.com](http://www.eduwonk.com/) if he tries to get in our way.

And that&#8217;s where you come in. Voting just started at the [Weblog Awards homepage](http://2006.weblogawards.org/) and stays open for the next 10 days. If you&#8217;re one of the four readers who doesn&#8217;t hate us, please help us Diebold the shit out of this thing &#8212; it&#8217;s weird, but they let you vote once a day. So expect us to issue a reminder or six. Together, between our relentless self-promotion and your need to do anything besides study for finals, we can win this thing, and finally bring the Ivy League some long-overdue attention after so many years of obscurity.

Seriously, though: Thanks. Now go vote! Early, often, and from multiple computers!
