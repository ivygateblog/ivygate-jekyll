Edmund S. Phelps of Columbia University [won](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/10/10/News/Cu.Econ.Prof.Awarded.Nobel.Prize-2341078.shtml?norewrite200610120257&sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com) a Nobel Prize in Economics Monday for his work on the relationship between unemployment and inflation. Craig Mello, Brown &#8217;82, [won](http://www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/10/11/CampusNews/Mello.82.Wins.Nobel.For.Medicine-2343737.shtml?norewrite200610122250&sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com) the Nobel in Medicine for developing a way to find out which genes cause certain diseases.

Congrats to you both! And to that third guy who also [won for something](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2006/10/13/News/Pamuk.Takes.Nobel.For.Literature-2349541.shtml), and is connected to Columbia in some way.

This should tell you something about our priorities around here.
