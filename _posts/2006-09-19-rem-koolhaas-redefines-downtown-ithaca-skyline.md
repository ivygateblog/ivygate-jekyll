As closet architecture nerds, we clicked ferociously upon the headline in this morning&#8217;s _New York Times_: &#8220;[A World-Famous Architect Goes Home to Cornell](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/arts/design/19corn.html).&#8221; No way, it&#8217;s Rem Koolhaas, cock of the walk! What new and exciting building would the creator of [these](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/Image:Koolhaas.cctv.jpg) [three](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/Image:Koolhaas.seattle.lib.1.jpg) [beauties](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/Image:CasadaMusica.jpg) bring to Cornell? Oh man, it&#8217;s gonna be totally radi&#8211;

The hell? Did Koolhaas design a pine tree? Sculpt that &#8220;No turn on red&#8221; sign? No &#8230; wait &#8230; it&#8217;s that horizontal thing waaay in the back, behind Rand Hall. Yeah, this scene&#8217;ll go right to the cover of the viewbook. Oh well &#8212; at least Cornell didn&#8217;t blow [$40 million](http://www.cornellsun.com/node/18378) on it or anything.
