Shit. Done. After only one day as commander-in-chief of Cornell University, [David J. Skorton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Skorton) has already divested from Sudan, taken the swim test, and met with George Pataki. [Twice](http://cornellsun.com/node/17933)! Students _love_ the guy &#8212; check out his 96 percent job approval rating, care of the _Sun_&#8216;s highly scientific [online poll](http://www.cornellsun.com/node/17924).

So with all this goodwill to spare, why the hell are Skorton and his wife moving into a [freshman dorm](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Aug06/convocation.gl.html)? &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he reassured the Class of 2010. &#8220;We won&#8217;t be keeping an eye on you.&#8221; Mister, you&#8217;re missing the point. They don&#8217;t want to keep an eye on _you_. Do you think students _want_ to pass the head of university administration coming out of the shower every morning? Listen to the amorous bedsqueaks of President and Mrs. Skorton? Those are things you can&#8217;t unsee, sir, things you can&#8217;t unhear. Don&#8217;t put the children through it.
