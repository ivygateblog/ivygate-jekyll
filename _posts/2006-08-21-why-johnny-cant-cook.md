No problem. Decontextualize Baudrillard&#8217;s main thesis of radical semiurgy? Piece of cake. Create an actual piece of cake? You know, like chocolate? [Ridiculously difficult](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701360.html).

&#8220;The only recipe I have the patience to follow is on the back of a Styrofoam cup of noodles: pour hot water, stir, enjoy. Pretty pathetic for a senior at Yale,&#8221; says Adriane Quinlan, writing about a Washington, D.C. kitchen boot camp in yesterday&#8217;s _Post_. Fellow culinary moron Ben Schneider, a junior at Penn, &#8220;is a chicken lover who has never actually stared its flesh in the face. He pokes it curiously, as if it could somehow be resuscitated, coddled back to life.&#8221;

We&#8217;ve long said that the cure for thinking highly of the Ivy League is attending one of its schools. But this &#8212; wait for it! &#8212; takes the cake. _[Ed.: Rimshot! We&#8217;ll be here all week, folks. Tip your waitresses.]_
