On Oct. 9, North Korea detonated a nuclear device. The same day, Aleksey Vayner [blew up](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/lord_of_the_lies_aleksey_vayner_outdoes_himself.html). Coincidence? Impossible is nothing.

Just for the record, we think this story has crested. Don&#8217;t get us wrong, our New Haven bureau will remain on 24-hour alert in case Alex gets kicked out of school &#8212; as the [president of Charity Navigator](http://trentstamp.blogspot.com/2006/10/im-not-laughing.html) is demanding &#8212; and we will forevermore bask in the glow of having helped to create a staggering cultural force. For example:

In other Vaynergate news:

  * Aleksey goes international, landing on the pages of a [London tabloid](http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=20878&in_page_id=2) and our [amusingly ad hominem](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/well_be_sure_to_show_this_to_our_lawyers_when_theyre_out_of_class.html#comment-1726) comments section&#8230;
  * &#8230; and American TV gets. even. stupider. MSNBC&#8217;s Donny Deutsch lauds Aleksey in a [four-minute segment](http://video.msn.com/v/us/msnbc.htm?g=e1d8ef1f-3fbf-4c78-8535-24a9c6377173&f=00&fg=copy), calling him a &#8220;brilliant creative executer&#8221; and declaring &#8220;I&#8217;d hire him sight unseen.&#8221; To Donny, and whatever moron interviewed him: _We have so much disdain for you._ Can we make that font any more italic?
  * Chuck Norris-inspired fan sites are sprouting everywhere, notably [here](http://www.wentsul.com/quotes) (&#8220;When Sir Edmund Hillary got to the top of Everest, it said &#8216;Aleksey was here&#8217; in yellow snow&#8221;) &#8230;
  * &#8230; and people continue to make fake [web](http://www.cutegirlsonly.com/profile.php?id=3106) [pages](http://www.myspace.com/alekseyvayner) in Aleksey&#8217;s name. Um, you counterfeiters get the irony here, don&#8217;t you?
