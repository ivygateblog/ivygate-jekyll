_NCAA rules, lamentably, stipulate that one Ivy League basketball team has to win the conference each year, and then get throttled in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in March. We don&#8217;t know which team will win, but we have a good idea of why each team won&#8217;t. Here&#8217;s Part II of our preview of the 2006-07 men&#8217;s basketball season, with teams listed from worst to slightly less worse:_

**4.Why Cornell won&#8217;t win:** When Cornell students want to get out of the cold and snow that blankets their campus 10 months of the year, what do they do? Do they sit inside a warm gym, cheering for an exciting, high-scoring basketball team? Nope. Instead, they&#8217;d rather stand around a frozen chunk of ice and watch a 0-0 scoreless tie. Talk about fun! The Big Red won&#8217;t start winning on the hardwood until people realize the school actually has a basketball team.

**3. Why Columbia won&#8217;t win:** Because they&#8217;re Columbia. How bad is Columbia at sports? Well, at last year&#8217;s homecoming, the highest-attended event on campus was the schools &#8220;Symposium on Losing,&#8221; in which alums could pester the president and athletic director about the school&#8217;s self-described &#8220;culture of losing.&#8221; One solution that came out of the symposium? Create a school mascot, a [freakishly large-breasted](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/10/13/Sports/Columbias.Breast.Still.Not.Good.Enough-2349172.shtml?norewrite200611091532&sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com) lion named Roar-ee. (Get it? You get it, right? &#8216;Cause lions roar? Roar-ee, with a hyphen! &#8220;Rory&#8221; would have totally gone over people&#8217;s heads!) This from the same university that gave us the Manhattan Project.

**2. Why Princeton won&#8217;t win:** A few reasons:
  
1.) Whereas nobody wants to play at Brown or Yale, Princeton coach Joe Scott doesn&#8217;t want anyone to play for him. Most schools start the basketball season with a &#8220;midnight madness&#8221; pep rally. Scott&#8217;s tenure at Princeton starts every year with his ceremonial purging of the team &#8212; where he kicks off five or six players.
  
2.) The Tigers&#8217; best player last year was Justin Conway. He started on Princeton&#8217;s JV team (that means he was unrecruited) and was called up to play center for the varsity squad because the Tigers were so bad. The one problem? He&#8217;s 6-foot-4. Most teams have guards bigger than him. The prospects of winning with Justin Conway as the leader of your team are similar to the prospects of winning with Howard Dean as the leader of your team &#8230; oh, wait.

**1. Why Penn won&#8217;t win:** Okay, we admit it. Penn is the only team in the league that we would refer to as a legitimate sports team. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t screw it up. There&#8217;s a new coach in town &#8212; former Brown head man Glen Miller &#8212; and there is ample precedent for a new coach coming into a talent-laden squad and screwing things up. Just ask Joe Scott. And no coach has better potential for a Chernobyl-like meltdown than Miller. But don&#8217;t take our word for it, take his: &#8220;We got jammed up our asses by three officials. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s such inbalance in this Goddamn league, because you can&#8217;t go to Penn and Princeton and get a fair shake.&#8221; (Full diatribe [here](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2003/02/17/Sports/Coach.Miller.Disappointed.With.Refs.In.First.Ivy.League.Loss.Of.Year-2155595.shtml?norewrite200611091534&sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com).) Well Glen, you&#8217;re with the Quakers now. You better win the &#8220;Goddamn league.&#8221;
