<img width="256" vspace="0" hspace="10" height="306" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/commonapp.jpg" alt="BREAKING: No, Really, Breaking -- Harvard Ends Early Admissions" />Harvard is announcing it will eliminate all forms of early admission, starting with the class of 2011 &#8212; finally acknowledging that such programs are the grotesque province of hypercynical applicants bent on improving their own odds at the expense of the disadvantaged.

Forgive the editorializing, please. This is both shocking news and yet long overdue, and it stirs all our leftover resentments about the college-choosing process. Yeah, we got in early decision. And everything about it was strategic &#8212; from the higher early acceptance rate to the promise of smoking pot and getting D&#8217;s from Dec. 15 till high school graduation. It felt okay, because early applicants think they&#8217;re calculating mostly against other equally calculating students. But there are undeniable consequences for students in school districts without top counselors, without adults who know how to grease the admissions process. And the universities themselves are just as complicit in the rankings-friendly game.

So anyway, we applaud this move by Derek Bok, who is apparently under the delusion that he&#8217;s _actually_ president of Harvard, not just a post-Summers stand-in. It&#8217;s like [_King Ralph_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102216/)!
