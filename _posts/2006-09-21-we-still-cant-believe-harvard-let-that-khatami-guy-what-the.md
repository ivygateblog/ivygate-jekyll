Looks like the Iranian president himself, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, will be speaking at Columbia this Friday, the _Spectator_ [reports](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/09/20/News/Iranian.President.Invited.To.Speak.At.Cu-2288980.shtml?norewrite200609201502&sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com). Gotta love that First Amendment, huh? If his [remarks](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html?hp&ex=1158897600&en=fd75007868ac87af&ei=5094&partner=homepage) at the United Nations yesterday were any indication, he plans a rousing disquisition on how the Holocaust never happened. (You wanna handle this one, [Mazower](http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Continent-Europes-Twentieth-Century/dp/067975704X/sr=1-1/qid=1158819028/ref=sr_1_1/104-2593012-6680737?ie=UTF8&s=books)?) No word yet on whether the president&#8217;s popped collar (see above) will make an appearance.

But here&#8217;s the weirdest part: Columbia President Lee Bollinger doesn&#8217;t seem to know who invited him! &#8220;I happen to find many of President Ahmadinejad&#8217;s stated beliefs to be repugnant, a view that I&#8217;m sure is widely shared within our university community,&#8221; Bollinger told _Spec_.

Bollinger also said he wasn&#8217;t sure the university could accomodate him on such short notice. Gotta love them First Amendment loopholes, huh?

**UPDATE 8:48 a.m.:** A new version of the story says the dean of the international relations school sent the invite, apparently without consulting her boss. Love it!
