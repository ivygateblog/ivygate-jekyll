Noisemaker sound effect!

We love you! Each and every one of you! Except the ones we don&#8217;t. But more on that [elsewhere](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/and_now_for_those_b_minuses.html) &#8212; right now, we just want to bring a few people up on stage:

  * [&#8220;Dude, my mom was addicted to crack. Party foul.&#8221;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/skorton_braves_hipster_jungle_forgets_iron_chef_t-shirt.html#comment-94) The funniest all week, hands down. Congratulations, Mr. &#8230; um, fuck, Anonymous. Identify yourselves, people, amusingly!
  * [&#8220;Breaking: Lamont&#8217;s daughter sits near alcoholic beverage. Of course its satire you morons.&#8221;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/breaking_ned_lamonts_daughter_sits_near_alcoholic_beverage.html#comment-80) Way to get our back, brah.
  * [&#8220;hey! that&#8217;s not very nice,&#8221;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/shalek_commits_horrible_breach_of_eli_trust.html#comment-69) by &#8220;salty dog saloon.&#8221;&nbsp; You kids today and your meta &#8230;
  * The bizarre scooter tangent found [here](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/prof_charles_nesson_now_permanently_high.html#comments). We were prepared to go some weird places when we started IvyGate. We were not prepared to go to the [Oklahoma Palliative Care Resources Blog](http://opcrc.blogspot.com/).
  * [&#8220;I&#8217;d suggest that her handlers advise her to skip a few sessions of cardio and instead cozy up with Strunk & White,&#8221;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/breaking_marisha_pessl_not_hot.html#comment-84) and all 474 words in the rest of Peter S.&#8217;s frightening comment &#8212; which he took care to post TWICE, on both our items about Marisha Pessl.

We likey. Keep it up, guys.
