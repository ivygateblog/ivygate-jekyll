A favorite _Washington Post_ columnist of ours once noted in an online chat that there exists a certain alternate spelling of the word &#8220;come&#8221;; that it often appears in erotic fiction; and that there appears to be absolutely no limit to how many M&#8217;s can be used in its construction.

Seriously, try it: Google &#8220;I&#8217;m cummmming!&#8221;, then &#8220;I&#8217;m cummmmming!&#8221;, etc, adding one more M each time. You simply will get search results. Even when you think you&#8217;ve hit the upper limit, fear not&#8211;add a few more, and we guarantee, you&#8217;ll find someone narrating his or her orgasm.

At this point you&#8217;re probably A) aroused, B) unnerved, and C) wondering what the fuck this has to do with the Ivy League. Here it is: the same principle applies to the phrase &#8220;[aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah+site%3Acollegeconfidential.com&btnG=Search)&#8221; at CollegeConfidential.com&#8217;s infamously neurotic message boards, where fingernail-gnawing high schoolers fret in public about every single detail of the admissions process. We got up to 39 A&#8217;s (no kidding) before getting bored. Let us know in the comments if you can beat the high score.
