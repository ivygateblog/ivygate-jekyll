If you&#8217;re still following Alekseyfest 2006, you might get a kick out of these &#8220;developments.&#8221; (If you&#8217;re new to all this, you&#8217;ll have to [start at the beginning](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/aleksey_vayner/).) We don&#8217;t blame anyone who wants to tap out at this point. Anyway, here&#8217;s the latest on our meal ticket:

**Even Aleksey Vayner&#8217;s lawyers are denying any connection to Aleksey Vayner.** _The Wall Street Journal_ phoned Vayner&#8217;s legal team and found this:

> &#8220;After initially saying in an interview that he was exploring privacy lawsuits, Mr. Vayner asked that further requests go through his Fort Lee, N.J., attorney. The lawyer said, via her assistant, that [she doesn&#8217;t represent Mr. Vayner](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/vaynerwsj.jpg).&#8221;

We took the _Journal_&#8216;s cue and called up Ron Bar-Nadav, the guy Vayner cc&#8217;ed on his &#8220;[cease and disist](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/well_be_sure_to_show_this_to_our_lawyers_when_theyre_out_of_class.html)&#8221; letter. We asked him if he represented Vayner: &#8220;No, sorry.&#8221; Click.

**Aleksey&#8217;s partner from the ballroom dance segment of the video wrote us to &#8220;clear my name.&#8221;** &#8220;I&#8217;m just a bystander in this whole mess,&#8221; Nansi says, noting that Aleksey is not her regular dancing partner, that she had no other role in creating the video, and that she&#8217;s been getting a lot of pervy attention from Internet weirdos. &#8220;And m<span>y outfit for the video is what I actually wear at dance competitions,&#8221; she adds, &#8220;so please do not make a big deal out of that since it is nothing out of the extraordinary in the ballroom world.&#8221; Noted! (As for Aleksey&#8217;s Under Armour, there&#8217;s really no excuse.) Nansi&#8217;s full e-mail is after the jump.</span>

**Aleksey may &#8212; may &#8212; have bought the ski footage in his video off Craigslist.** A tipster wrote us last night with what could be an amazing document &#8212; if it&#8217;s real. He claims to have a copy of a Craigslist post from August; the file looks real, but then again, Craigslist pages might be the most easily faked on the Internet, and there&#8217;s a rash of fake Aleksey stuff floating around. Plus, who saves Craigslist pages? Judge for yourself:

>   <span><span>This is a friendly message from the girl dancing with Aleksey Vayner in his video &#8220;Impossible is Nothing.&#8221;&nbsp; Lately, I&#8217;ve been receiving a lot of emails from inquisitive strangers who have seen me on his video and have asked me more details on Aleksey, the video, and myself.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t answer any questions on Aleksey or the accusations, since I don&#8217;t think it is my position to do so, and for all of you who wanted to know more through me, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to disappoint you.&nbsp; However, I do wish to set the&nbsp;record straight on my role in the video.</span></span>

>   <span>Aleksey and I danced together for&nbsp;his video,&nbsp;but we are not regular dancing partners.&nbsp; I had no role on the conception, production, filming, or editing of the reel, and I was only present&nbsp;during the dance sequence.&nbsp; It was of my understanding that&nbsp;the&nbsp;dance piece&nbsp;was to be used&nbsp;for a personal documentary on himself, his achievements, and his&nbsp;interests, so&nbsp;I accepted to help him as his partner.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know whether those serves were 140 mph or how he got to break the bricks that way, so my guess is just as good as yours.&nbsp; However, he did tell me he won a bench pressing competition lifting 495 pounds (with shirt) this summer, and participated in martial arts competitions.</span>
