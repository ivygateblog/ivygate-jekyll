Or maybe it&#8217;s best [captured](http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3822/is_199810/ai_n8823197/pg_3) by Toni Morrison&#8217;s &#8220;third beer &#8230; the one you drink because it&#8217;s there&#8221; theory. Yeah, yeah, they do the infamous Sex Week at Yale, plus that whole [Porn &#8216;n Chicken](http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxxi/2001.02.09/news/p4150221woman.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxxi/2001.02.09/news/p4.html&h=221&w=150&sz=15&hl=en&start=7&tbnid=_mbipLhVTn7p6M:&tbnh=107&tbnw=73&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dyale%2Bsex%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DG) thing happened. We just have trouble imagining sex in New Haven as anything but purely functional.

Now a [survey](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=33412) by Trojan Condoms tells us Yale has the most sexually healthy campus in the country &#8212; and&nbsp;it&#8217;s got&nbsp;nothing to do with how much sex they&#8217;re having, safe or otherwise. Criteria include availability of condoms on campus (&#8220;Take what you need, not what you hope you need&#8221;), access to STI information and testing, and, oddly, whether they have a sex columnist.

Harvard, meanwhile, gets an F for condom scarcity and no sex column. The _YDN_ [quotes](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=33412) a Harvard peer counselor as saying, &#8220;<span class="ArticleText">The thing about Harvard students is that they are so difficult to cater to and difficult to please, and <strong>it&#8217;s hard to get information to people who are brilliant</strong>.&#8221; Hmm. Know what? If gonorrhea is the price of brilliance, we&#8217;ll take our C-average, thank you very much.<br /></span>

**Bonus:** The Yale blog 06520-2848 (nice dig, guy) has a good analysis [here](http://06520-2848.blogspot.com/2006/09/yales-bringin-sexual-health-awarenessy.html).

**UPDATE 11:48 a.m.:** Penn buys 50,000 (and if you pronounce that &#8220;50 large,&#8221; it gets funnier) condoms every year, the DP [reports](http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/09/29/News/Pencils.Paper.And.50000.Condoms-2316866.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com). Anybody got a figure for the other schools?
