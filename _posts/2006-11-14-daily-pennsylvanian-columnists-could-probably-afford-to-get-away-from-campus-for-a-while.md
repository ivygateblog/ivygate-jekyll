<img width="300" vspace="0" hspace="10" height="390" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/snooty.jpg" alt="<em>Daily Pennsylvanian</em> Columnists Could Probably Afford to Get Away From Campus for a While" />When writers at [The Buzz](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/?section=1) &#8212; the _Daily Pennsylvanian_ sports blog &#8212; decide to talk some serious smack, it&#8217;s normally directed towards a) an Ivy League rival or b) [the opposing team&#8217;s uniforms](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?section=1&keyword=12).

But up-and-coming _DP_ sportswriter Andrew Scurria &#8217;09 decided to direct his ire this weekend towards all 2,000 students at Brooklyn&#8217;s innocent little St. Francis College, in a post that is [the definition of why people hate the Ivy League](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?page=post&section=1&id=505). An excerpt:

> Young men go to places like Syracuse because each wants the other.
> 
> They go to Penn or UTEP because the school wants them and can at least offer something in return.
> 
> Unfortunately, they often go to places like St. Francis because they have nowhere else to turn.

St. Francis: Where young men go because they have nowhere else to turn! Now that has a ring to it. But pretentious as Scurria&#8217;s item is, it&#8217;s no match for the posturing of [Chloe Hurley](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?section=2&keyword=29). The _DP_ editorial columnist [warns students](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?page=post&section=2&id=427) not to post too many pics of themselves on Facebook, because &#8220;overexposure now means less mystique later.&#8221;

> The real truth that I must face is that if I want to be successful later, I&#8217;m going to have to keep a paper bag over my head right now. And this isn&#8217;t just to avoid [One Night In Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Night_in_Paris)-type debacles. This is because I want to be a Serious Writer with a good jacket photo.

> Don DeLillo&#8217;s reclusive protagonist in _Mao II_ said that, &#8220;when a writer doesn&#8217;t show his face, he becomes a local symptom of God&#8217;s famous reluctance to appear.&#8221; Well, I want to be God.

What was that about being careful what you post online again?&nbsp;
