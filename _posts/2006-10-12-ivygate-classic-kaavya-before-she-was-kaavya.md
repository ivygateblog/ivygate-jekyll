(We&#8217;ll say it again: we were born a year late.) Long story short, the Isis, one of Harvard&#8217;s sororities, accidentally left its &#8220;punch book,&#8221; a forum where sisters commented on each punch candidate, [accessible on the web](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=509316). Punchers got drilled for &#8220;fake smiling,&#8221; having a &#8220;self-serving attitude,&#8221; or &#8220;trying way way way too hard&#8221; &#8212; and the whole world knew it. Cattiness abounded, reputations crumbled, hilarity ensued.

<img width="159" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="154" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/kaavyalogosmall2.gif" alt="IvyGate Classic: Kaavya Before She Was Kaavya" />A Harvard tipster points out that one puncher &#8212; you&#8217;ll _never_ guess who &#8212; was [described](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=509317) as &#8220;the NEXT BIG THING and it would be a coup to have her in the club,&#8221; although she&#8217;s &#8220;a little awkward. I thought so after the first event but was also suayed [sic] by her air of sophistication and fashion sense.&#8221;

Awkward? Fashionable? THE NEXT BIG THING?! We&#8217;ll kill the suspense and reveal, with the wisdom of hindsight, that Ms. Kaavya Viswanathan is now a proud Isis member. When this season&#8217;s punch book gets leaked, we&#8217;ll be sure to vet it for, uh, similarities to last year&#8217;s.
