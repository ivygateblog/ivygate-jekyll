> &#8220;I nominate Paize Keulemans, who taught a class in EALAC [East Asian Languages and Cultures] at Columbia last semester and is currently an associate professor at Yale. **This Dutchman&#8217;s chiseled features and stimulating range of vocabulary motivated me to go to class.** Basically, every girl in the class wanted to jump his bones. I also have a story about a friend who tried to seduce him in an elevator &#8230;
> 
> &#8220;Girl A and B (who are friends) leave his class and get into an elevator. girl A lets B take an elevator by herself and upon getting into another one with Prof. Keulemans, he asks her something like &#8216;what&#8217;s wrong with your friend that she has to take the elevator by herself?&#8217; Girl A then tells him that she would like to sleep with him and he chuckles, says nothing. Then he replies, &#8216;You know, I&#8217;m married [to another prof at Columbia]&#8217; to which Girl A responds, **&#8216;I&#8217;m in a serious relationship. I don&#8217;t care.&#8217;** Awkward silence ensues, he reaches his predestined floor and exits.&#8221;

Awesome emphasis ours. _Help us find this irresistible man!_&nbsp;And if you haven&#8217;t already,&nbsp;[get nominatin&#8217;](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com). Deadline noon tomorrow.
