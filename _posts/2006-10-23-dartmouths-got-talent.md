Okay, so this scene from Dartmouth&#8217;s Chi Heorot frat basement is just impressive.

A Dartmouth correspondent explains:

> What he&#8217;s doing is a &#8220;Quick Six.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know how widespread that particular drinking challenge is beyond Dartmouth, but this guy must have been in the top three or four kids in our class; I&#8217;ve never seen faster. (I rocked out at 26 seconds at my peak, and I have a friend who clocks in at about 14-16.)
