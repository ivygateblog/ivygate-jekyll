<img width="181" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="230" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/okounkov.jpg" alt="Enigmatic Soviet Hermit Eclipses Princeton Math Geek" />Princeton University professor of mathematics Andrei Okounkov is getting laid to-night! The Fields Medals &#8212; the Nobels of &#8216;rithmetic, given every four years &#8212; were [awarded in Madrid](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/science/22cnd-math.html) today, and Doc Ok&#8217;s work on the changing surfaces of melting crystals (&#8220;The boundary between melted and non-melted is created randomly, but the random process inevitably produces a border in the shape of a heart&#8221; &#8212; thanks, _New York Times_!) got a nod.

Unfortunately, two other winners are hogging all the attention. One is Dr. Terence Tao of UCLA, the youngest Fields winner ever at 31; the other is Dr. Grigori Perelman, a Russian hermit-genius with an [insane beard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) who only, um, solved the Poincar&eacute; Conjecture. Apparently it&#8217;s something that baffled the globe for a century. But, uh &#8230; melting crystals! They&#8217;re cool too, right?
