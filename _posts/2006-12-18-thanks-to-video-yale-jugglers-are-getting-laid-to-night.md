We&#8217;re sure juggling is hard and all, and this clip, from the [Yale Anti-Gravity Society](http://yags.sfcave.com/), is certainly impressive. We&#8217;d probably kill ourselves just by attempting three of the bowling pins, whereas the YAGS guys use flaming torches and what appear to be scimitars. Honestly, though, we&#8217;re pretty sure our grandmother could have edited a better promo video with nothing but a spool of 8mm filmstock, Scotch tape, and her teeth. And setting the whole thing to the Transiberian Orchestra&#8217;s goofy &#8220;Appalachian Snowfall&#8221; and using up every last video transition in Final Cut Pro does little to dispel juggling&#8217;s reputation as a refuge for well-coordinated outcasts.

Unless, of course, it&#8217;s one big joke &#8212; which it clearly is. After all, these are the guys who put on a show last semester entitled &#8220;[The Iliad &#8211; with juggling](http://yags.sfcave.com/photos/sp_index.php?dir=./Spring%20Shows/2006%20-%20The%20Iliad%20-%20with%20juggling).&#8221; The group&#8217;s leadership positions include &#8220;Minister of Armaments&#8221; and &#8220;Minister of Fresh Blood.&#8221; So good luck, guys: if keeping ten fiery sticks aloft at once doesn&#8217;t translate into social and romantic success &#8230; well, then there&#8217;s something very wrong with this world.
