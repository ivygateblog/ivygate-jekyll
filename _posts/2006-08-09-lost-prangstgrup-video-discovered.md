There was a time when student groups knew the meaning of public service. And when it came to capturing the absurdities of college, Columbia&#8217;s [Prangstr&#252;p](http://www.prangstgrup.com) led the way. A few of their videos have recently resurfaced on YouTube, naturally rocketing to the top of the charts. But one of their most brilliant efforts was missing: the infamous NYU tour video. Legend has it the group pulled the clip from its website after the NYU admissions office complained. But thanks to the lawless cyber-country that is YouTube, it&#8217;s here to stay. Watch it. Then watch it again. Then pray Prangstgr&#252;p will one day return.
