Aw, college. Anybody have any idea what&#8217;s going on in these clips?

**UPDATE 4:47 p.m.:** The videographer emails us to report:

> The teacher is Justine Hastings and the class is Econ 115: An Intro to Micro-economics. These videos were taken yesterday, on the last day of class. No one in the class likes Justine as a professor (we refer to her by her first name), and so the Pundits (the all-seniors campus prank group) came in and protested her on her final day of class with a baseball theme. They had all sorts of baseball paraphernalia, from wiffle balls to peanuts and popcorn. The Pundits also had members decked out in face and body paint and carrying signs. This display went on for about five minutes, until the trumpet played pulled off his shorts and streaked out of class.
> 
> Justine then proceeded to comment that &#8220;I told my male colleagues that if anyone stripped in my class, I would drag them before ExComm [the disciplinary board] for sexual harassments. I didn&#8217;t see any distinctive marks, though. Did any of you?&#8221;
