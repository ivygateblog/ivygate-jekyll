When does government snooping stop being funny and start being scary? Right about &#8230; [now](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/04/us/04monitor.html).

A handful of universities have signed on to develop software that monitors negative opinion of the U.S. The program, paid for by a $2.4 million grant from Homeland Security, would automatically interpret news and opinion in the press and sniff out potential threats. &#8220;Sentiment analysis,&#8221; they call it. &#8220;Pant-soilingly disturbing&#8221; might be our choice of words.

Not to mention, when&#8217;s the last time Osama bin Laden wrote an op-ed for the _Times_?&nbsp;
  
&nbsp;
  
But here&#8217;s the worst part: Our very own Cornell &#8212; sweet, innocent Cornell &#8212; is joining the consortium. We wish Cornell Prez David Skorton best of luck beta testing his new gadgetry on the _Sun_, as long as he stays away from us. Because after [this](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/hello_cornell_coeds_my_name_is_david_skorton_and_i_am_here_to_sex_you_down.html), [this](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/skorton_popularity_now_just_getting_weird.html), and [this](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/year_of_the_college_blog_off_to_a_bad_start.html), we just might constitute a major threat.
