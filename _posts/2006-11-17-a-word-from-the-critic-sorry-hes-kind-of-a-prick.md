This was only partially because of how they smelled. I resisted at first mostly because the idea sounded insane: 1) call for submissions from Ivy League bands, 2) actually listen to these submissions and 3) comment on the most interesting ones. Number two in particular. I listened to plenty of Ivy League bands at my alma mater. They tended to cover &#8220;What I Got.&#8221; By Sublime. And I tended to want to poke them with a knife.

    But here I am. Why? The audacity of hope. Perhaps your band can prove me wrong. That and the editors of IvyGate actually bothered to design this elaborte iTunes-style logo, so I took pity on them. With that, submit away. Who knows? You might win some new fans among IvyGate&#8217;s readership, which currently stands at 14.

    Oh, and one more thing. I reserve the right to review any MP3 you send in &#8212; even (or, because I&#8217;m a sadist, especially) if they&#8217;re horrible.&nbsp; Let the games begin.
