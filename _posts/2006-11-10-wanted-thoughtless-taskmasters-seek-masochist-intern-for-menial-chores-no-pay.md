(But [endless college credit](http://www.slate.com/id/2143298/)!) It&#8217;s the biggest scam since yearbook photos. And we want in.

WANTED: An IvyGate intern. We put out feelers during (cough) an [interview](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515624) with the _Crimson_, but we want to open it up to the whole world, non-Ivies included. Are you bursting with rage beneath a sassy veneer? Want to get banned from your campus daily? How about getting punched/laid/ignored at parties? We guarantee one of the three!

Please [get in touch](mailto:%20ivygate@gmail.com) (orphans only; no Irish) if you&#8217;re interested and we&#8217;ll tell you what&#8217;s next. Basically, we&#8217;re looking for a current undergrad to find items and update the site when we&#8217;re unavailable. Must give good blog; Movable Type and HTML nerdery a plus; borderline alcoholism encouraged. Note that we already have stringers here and there chipping in items &#8212; the point of the intern role is to be available all the time, help with site upkeep, and generally be kicked around by everyone. Either this sounds awful or great; you know who you are. Applicants enclosing resumes will be rejected unseen.

  (*Aside from, um, the people who really are exploited.)
