Last time we checked in on Harvard Law Professor Charles Nesson, he was busy creating [the most insane class ever](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/prof_charles_nesson_now_permanently_high.html). Now we finally get to peek inside that class, and who is guest lecturing but fallen _Village Voice_ fabulist Nick Sylvester. Apparently Nesson thought it would be appropriate to explore the fuzzy ethics of journalistic, um, creativity by bringing in someone who learned the hard way.

Sylvester, you&#8217;ll recall, is the recent Harvard grad who caused a medium-sized New York media scandal this spring when he [made up](http://gawker.com/news/top/the-voice-is-even-more-fucked-up-than-usual-157816.php) part of a _Voice_ cover on a book about pickup artists. Thoroughly humiliated, Nick retreated from view for a while. Between some recent writing and now this, the guy is finally peeking his head out.

And the faker just doesn&#8217;t get it. The video below, which features Sylvester fumbling to explain why yes, it was a mistake but no, &#8220;I don&#8217;t regret it,&#8221; left [Gawker](http://www.gawker.com/news/nick-sylvester/fake-writer-lectures-future-lawyers-on-art-and-artifice-208844.php) and [Idolator](http://www.idolator.com/tunes/nick-sylvester/nick-sylvesters-harvard-lecture-this-clip-will-crash-your-computer-and-crush-your-soul-208790.php) speechless. You can only watch Sylvester shoot himself in the foot so many times before it feels cruel, so we cut the 2-hour clip down to seven minutes.

The hero of the day is Nesson himself (the man they dubbed &#8220;Billion Dollar Charlie&#8221; in _A Civil Action_ &#8212; he&#8217;s actually amazingly sharp for a stoner) for calling Sylvester on his horseshit. But he does it in that mild, sensible way that makes his points all the more cutting. He articulates what&#8217;s at stake: People need to know what they&#8217;re reading. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether a writer is telling the truth or playing with the truth as long as that is disclosed. Nesson is generous to call Sylvester&#8217;s writing &#8220;art,&#8221; as if it&#8217;s somehow exempt from journalistic standards even when its satirical intent (or whatever intent Sylvester imagined) isn&#8217;t clear. Charlie, you&#8217;re back on our buddy list.
