[Deadspin](http://www.deadspin.com), the smartest sports blog around, unleashes its &#8220;Four Tiny Tidbits&#8221; football preview feature on [li&#8217;l ol&#8217; us](http://deadspin.com/sports/ivy-league/four-tiny-tidbits-on-the-ivy-league-192728.php) today. Charitably declining to mention [our warts](http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/colfootball/teams/worst.html), they focus mostly on the good and the fun, like the three legendary pranks MIT pulled after infiltrating the 1982 Harvard-Yale game.

Conspicuously absent from mention, though, was Yale&#8217;s <strike>epic</strike> <strike>titanic</strike> <strike>intergalactic</strike> simply brilliant prank at The Game in 2004. Impersonating the nonexistent &#8220;Harvard Pep Squad,&#8221; Yale &#8217;05ers Michael Kai and David Aulicino tricked almost 2,000 Crimson fans into holding up signs that said, succinctly, &#8220;WE SUCK.&#8221; Details [here](http://www.harvardsucks.org/) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale's_%22We_Suck%22_Prank), and you can watch the clip here:

Also: Deadspin tipster Brett Hoover, [see us](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com) after class. Who are you? How&#8217;d you get involved with those Gawker Media deadbeats? We can pay you at least as poorly as they do!
