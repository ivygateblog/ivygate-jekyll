&#8220;THE GREAT IVY LEAGUE NUDE POSTURE PHOTO SCANDAL.&#8221;** That&#8217;s the blaring headline from the stodgy _New York Times_, so there&#8217;s not much sensationalism we can add to this mind-blowing piece from January 1995 on the fact that _thousands and thousands of students from both genders at Princeton, Harvard, Yale and other elite schools were officially photographed completely naked, with metal pins jabbed into their spines, with racist undertones, spanning decades and kept in secret archives that included Hillary Clinton, Diane Sawyer, George Bush, Bob Woodward, Meryl Streep and ohmygod this sentence is never going to end because did we mention this is BLOWING OUR MINDS?!_

You gotta read it. All of it. [Right here.](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D91131F936A25752C0A963958260&sec=health&pagewanted=all) Reporter Ron Rosenbaum is our new hero.
