This year, it looks like some students are [skipping The Game](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515612)&nbsp;again, only this time it&#8217;s deliberate.&nbsp;Now that Yale [won&#8217;t be subsidizing](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=34054) the $60 round-trip bus ride to Cambridge, and Harvard [won&#8217;t be tacitly condoning reckless inebriation](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/breaking_alcohol_banned_at_harvardyale_tailgates_students_already_pregaming.html), Elis are trying to get psyched about this weekend&#8217;s match against Princeton instead. Not one of The eight tailgate spaces set aside for Yale at The Harvard-Yale game has been taken, [according](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515612) to The _Crimson_. All this predicts a lackluster game &#8212; at this point, The team may not even bother to show.

  But wait, there&#8217;s hope! Some Yalies are fighting The Harvard-Yale bureaucracy with the best weapon available: wealth. A tipster in New Haven tells us &#8220;at least one group of seniors has hired a 15-person <span class="st">limo</span> to ferry it north in style. A competitive price and the ability to pack open containers of alcohol were both cited as enticements.&#8221;&nbsp;Clever way to stick it to The athletic department brass? Sure. The reason people hate Ivy Leaguers? Absolutely.
