<img width="364" vspace="10" hspace="5" height="449" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/sylvester.jpg" alt="Nick Sylvester Now Getting Paid to Make Shit Up" />When a journalist [gets caught fabricating](http://www.gawker.com/news/nick-sylvester/sylvestergate-today-in-nick-news-158229.php), he must atone for bringing shame on the profession by never being allowed to work again. Or at least that&#8217;s the theory. In [reality](http://themediamob.observer.com/2006/03/the-liars-club-an-incomplete-history-of-untruths-and-consequ.html), they usually go on time-out for five minutes before staging a quiet comeback, often in a different medium. Case in point: Nick Sylvester, Harvard &#8217;04.

After last week&#8217;s post on Sylvester&#8217;s [embarrassing guest appearance](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/nick_sylvester_selfimmolates_at_harvard_law_school.html) in Prof. Charlie Nesson&#8217;s Harvard Law class &#8212; in which The Fabricatin&#8217; Kid gave not the slightest indication he understood his sins &#8212; someone informed us (perhaps inadvertently) that Sylvester has a new job working for &#8230; drumroll! &#8230; _The Colbert Report_. We checked, and hosannahs, Idolator did [allude](http://www.idolator.com/tunes/pitchfork/update-pitchforks-latest-hire-gets-a-45-203214.php) to this a month ago &#8212; but no one noticed.

Really?! This is _perfect_. Is there a better gig for a fact-challenged guy than one where it&#8217;s built right into the job description? It&#8217;s like a convicted arsonist getting hired at a crematorium.
