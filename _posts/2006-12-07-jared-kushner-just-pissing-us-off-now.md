You know, when Jared Kushner, Harvard &#8217;03, [bought the](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/breaking_rich_guy_who_graduated_from_harvard_15_minutes_ago_buys_newspaper.html) _[New York Observer](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/breaking_rich_guy_who_graduated_from_harvard_15_minutes_ago_buys_newspaper.html)_ in July _[Ed.: Private to non-news dorks and/or the poor: It&#8217;s a pink weekly newspaper with often unbeatable stuff on Manhattan media, real estate and gossip]_ we were all up in his wheelhouse. Sure, he was a rich snot, but if we had that kind of loot we&#8217;d do exactly the same thing: buy a cool paper on the cheap and start raising hell. We wished the golden boy and his gold well.

Then we found out [Papa Kushner](http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/mon/index.jsp) [bought Jared&#8217;s Harvard acceptance letter](http://www.jossip.com/gossip/jared-kushner/jared-kushners-harvard-bribe-justified-with-good-marks-20060823.php) with a $2.5 mil <strike>bribe</strike> donation, and didn&#8217;t hear a lot of cool stuff out of _Observer_ headquarters. And now the guy&#8217;s [dropping $1.8 billion](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/business/06cnd-building.html) on a single office tower in Manhattan.

At what point does impressively rich become filthy rich? Yeah, probably somewhere around the time you buy a Manhattan skyscraper. Maybe real estate just doesn&#8217;t excite us as much as catty pink newsprint, but we&#8217;re a little worried our friend Jar Jar is jumping a whole tank of sharks with this move. It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re only 25 minutes into the movie, but Charles Foster Kane is already about to crash and burn.
