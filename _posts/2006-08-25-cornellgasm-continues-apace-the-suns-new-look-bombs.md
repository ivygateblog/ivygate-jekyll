The _Cornell Daily Sun_ greeted students back to campus yesterday with an overhaul of [cornelldailysun.com](http://www.cornelldailysun.com). Now the reviews are in, and they are &#8230; [less than raves](http://www.cornelldailysun.com/node/17877). This calls for bullet points, lots of bullet points:

  * &#8220;awful&#8221;
  * &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t feel like a newspaper&#8221;
  * &#8220;all [the other Ivy dailies] were more professional looking&#8221;
  * &#8220;simply terrible&#8221;
  * &#8220;completely user unfriendly&#8221;
  * &#8220;major step backwards&#8221;
  * &#8220;Not looking too good&#8221;
  * &#8220;Please head over to the COMM department and let them markup what is wrong with the site&#8221; _[Ed.: Ouch! Our favorite.]_
  * &#8220;my high school paper&#8217;s web site looks more professional&#8221; _[Ed.: Spoke too soon!]_
  * &#8220;it&#8217;s lacking!&#8221;&nbsp;<!--[endif]-->

To be fair, there was a lone dissent.

  * &#8220;I like it. A lot. Sorry.&#8221;

We&#8217;re not quite sure where that leaves the _Sun_ &#8212; the current site is actually a redesign of a redesign. The [temporary summer site&#8217;s logo](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/old_sun_logo.jpg) displeased one commenter, who wrote that the historic nameplate had been &#8220;pushed into a slanted murky background &#8230; like some thought that can no longer be recognized as either a dream or a true recollection.&#8221; Damn, where can we get some of this dude&#8217;s moonshine?
