In the looks department, IvyGate has always ranked somewhere between Randy Johnson and [Uglydog](http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/uglydog.asp). Tired of getting the &#8220;But you have a nice personality!&#8221; brush-off from girls (because we know that ain&#8217;t true), we set off in search of a facelift. **Kyle Jaster of [Kyle Jaster Studio](http://kylejasterstudio.com/)** came to the rescue, half because he&#8217;s really talented, half because he was sleeping with a friend of ours and gave us a good deal. (Also, his apartment in Brooklyn is right near ours and he has this totally sweet four-way hookah.) We encourage everyone to hire Kyle for gobs of money, whether you have a web site or not.

**UPDATE 4:31 p.m.:** While the early feedback has us crying into our pillow &#8212; our lone defenders thus far are [a high school kid](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/barbara_bush_displays_remarkable_commitment_to_drinking.html#comment-4724) and a person or persons known as [&#8220;weenus&#8221;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/excuse_us_while_we_slip_into_something_more_comfortable.html#comment-4810) &#8212; we think y&#8217;all will like it in the end. (Maybe we should have [seen](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/cornellgasm_continues_apace_the_suns_new_look_bombs.html) [this](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/upenn_student_paper_insists_beauty_is_on_the_inside.html) [coming](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/the_worst_thing_to_happen_to_college_newspapers_since_sex_columnists.html).)

**UPDATE NO. 2, 7:08 p.m.:** Enormous comments font in Safari &#8212; got it. Keep it coming &#8230;
