Last week we brought you the glory that is BK2Night, the planet&#8217;s [best rap about sustainably produced organic greens](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/fool_you_cant_get_into_berkeley_tonight.html). Now a Yale tipster writes in with the complete lyrics, annotated so that non-Elis can join in the fun. After the jump, follow the bouncing blue ball &#8230;

(Refrain)
  
Now this is one of them occasions where the dining hall&#8217;s not doing it right
  
I mean you found you a food that you like
  
But you can&#8217;t get into Berkeley tonight
  
And when it all boils down you gonnna find in the end
  
Your meal&#8217;s on a plan but Annette<sup>1</sup> ain&#8217;t paid to be your friend
  
So what you found a hall that you like? Fool, you can&#8217;t get into Berkeley tonight

I mostly ate late from a thin paper plate
  
Making mac & cheese
  
Please, this shit ain&#8217;t got no taste (Where the fuck is Pan Geos?<sup>2</sup>)
  
I cannot eat at Commons<sup>3</sup>
  
I need to eat well, not come on home to pots that&#8217;s full of ramen
  
I wanna be bombin, and taking advantage
  
In Berkeley dining hall with my full meal plannage<sup>4</sup>
  
But I&#8217;ll manage (Get your salad out my face!)
  
Bitch, I&#8217;m &#8217;bout to switch, go get grits from Jaylyn&#8217;s Place<sup>5</sup>
  
Learn the playa rules, this is how a playa moves
  
Ain&#8217;t PC but Yorkside<sup>6</sup> it got me hungry
  
Food dollas I blowed &#8217;em, I can&#8217;t control &#8217;em
  
Swiped drinks twice at the law school, went and sold &#8217;em
  
Annette&#8217;s sweatin me, won&#8217;t let me eat a BK dinner
  
Organic greens and free range to get the girls thinner
  
It&#8217;s a trip don&#8217;t trip &#8217;em up in Yorkside Flex-in&#8217;
  
Fuck BK for hating like a presidential Texan

(Refrain)

Now to the law school, Commons or the Saybrugians (yeah bitches)
  
Much love to y&#8217;all cause when you see PC
  
You know you have to let us in<sup>7</sup>
  
As for BK what should we do
  
Even twentieth in line I won&#8217;t abandon my crew
  
So we tried Berkeley stickers and tried sweatshirts
  
We pulled pimp canes and we tried to flirt<sup>8</sup>
  
We brainstormed entries, even supplementaries
  
But surface door sentries wouldn&#8217;t let us in the pantries
  
The food is organic, security is manic
  
Some students get in, the rest is straight banished

I&#8217;ll take Annette back to Swing Space,<sup>9</sup> she can chill at the spot
  
From the way she be chillin I know she does it a lot
  
I roll a 8 and a half, a 9 and three-quarters
  
The blunt&#8217;ll be fillin when I call her on the illin
  
We share picket lines during hard strike times<sup>10</sup>
  
Now she&#8217;s a sign of the BK crimes
  
I want a pass for PC and everybody
  
And while you&#8217;re all at it, whyn&#8217;t you make that shit free?<sup>11</sup>
  
Yeah the food is aight but it ain&#8217;t so tight
  
That it break a G down, break me down
  
So I&#8217;ma see you on the rebound, PC style, mothafucka
  
Biatch!

(refrain)

Shoutout to Peggy holding it down in Commons
  
Willy &#8230; Merle, where you at?<sup>12</sup>
  
Yeah all the Pierson dining hall staff we miss you,
  
Much love to all the family&#8230;

<sup>1</sup> the formidable card-swiper/gatekeeper at Berkeley Dining Hall
  
<sup>2</sup> moderately popular &#8220;ethnic food&#8221; station operated by Yale Dining Services in several dining halls
  
<sup>3</sup> The large, impersonal dining hall most often frequented by athletes after practice. Cheeseburgers and fries are their specialty and even then we&#8217;re talking dry and drier.
  
<sup>4</sup> full meal plan: $2,280 per semester
  
<sup>5</sup> delicious soul food on Park Street
  
<sup>6</sup> Yorkside Pizza is one of the few establishments off campus that accepts Yale flex points
  
<sup>7</sup> Pierson College was being renovated in 2003-2004, so PC students were always allowed into the Saybrook dining hall, despite whatever restrictions were in place
  
<sup>8</sup> doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ve tried
  
<sup>9</sup> the holding pen for members of residential colleges that are being renovated
  
<sup>10</sup> Yale and its employees have a penchant for shitty labor relations and disruptive work stoppages
  
<sup>11</sup> Did I mention a full meal plan is $2,280 per semester?
  
<sup>12</sup> Pierson dining hall staff, much beloved
