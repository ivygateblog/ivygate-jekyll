The _Chronicle of Higher Education_&#8216;s [annual report on executive compensation](http://chronicle.com/indepth/compensation/) is in, and there you have it, in primary colors: former Cornell president Jeff Lehman can buy and sell your president before lunch, with enough left over for 375 PlayStation 3&#8217;s.

Lehman banked $1,004,034 in _Ithaca_ dollars, mind you, further raising the cost-of-living premium over suckers like Larry Summers (sniff) and Lee Bollinger. James Wright of Dartmouth was the big loser, unable to crack the half-mil barrier; in the co-ed, towel-snapping locker room of Ivy presidents past and present, he&#8217;s the one changing beneath a towel.

Cue ominous music: But what price victory, Jeff? The _Sun_ reported last month that a chunk of Lehman&#8217;s payout was [hush money](http://cornellsun.com/node/19065), to keep him from blabbing about the controversy surrounding his departure.

Moving on, there&#8217;s more fun to be had with the _Chronicle_&#8216;s data, especially in the expense account category. We don&#8217;t know why Wright and Ruth Simmons are listed as having $0 at their disposal; we do know that it&#8217;s kinda funny Bollinger gets to blow a full fifth of Wright&#8217;s entire salary on hookers and goofballs. And poor Dick Levin! Twelve thousand dollars a year? Someone get this man a financial aid package!
