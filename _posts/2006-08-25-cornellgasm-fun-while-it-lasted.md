Just joining us via the $5 flyer we bought on Facebook today? We have a slight correction to make: Contrary to the ad copy, you may not, in fact, &#8220;kiss our Big, Red ass.&#8221;

Our ass is not monochromatic. You may quote us on that. It&#8217;s Big Green, too &#8212; and Crimson and Tiger-striped and all the other colors of the happy li&#8217;l Ivy rainbow. No matter what school the news comes from, we&#8217;ll happily mock the shit out of it.

News, gossip, sex, sports, etc., you get the drift. This is our 50th post, and we hardly expect you to wade through that much pap. Catch up with these Cliffs Notes instead.

  * **[I Got 95 Theses and a Bitch Ain&#8217;t One](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/about_us.html)**:&nbsp;Our first post. The bloody sheet is still hanging on our balcony.
  * **[The Ivy Taxonomy: Meet The Players](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/do_you_know_who_youre_dealing.html)**: Every single stereotype about the Ivy League is true.
  * **[Lost Prangstgrup Video Discovered!](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/lost_prangstgrup_video_discovered.html)**: Schliemann discovered Troy, Carter unearthed King Tut, we dug up this.
  * [**Year of the College Blog Begins &#8230; Now**](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/year_of_the_college_blog_begins_now.html): A bold prediction! That Cornell [ruined](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/year_of_the_college_blog_off_to_a_bad_start.html)!
  * **[i&#8217;m Applyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyying!](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/im_applyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyying.html)**: Original journalism.
  * **[_U.S. NEWS_ BOMBSHELLS: The Aftermath](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/us_news_bombshell_the_aftermath.html)**: Just thinking about it sends our resting pulse rate to 90.

Thanks for coming, Cornell. Now explore, comment, stick around, like that Adderall habit.
