Our first bestseller binge included _[The Rule of Four](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385337116)_; for those of you &#8212; wow, a hundred percent, really? &#8212; who avoid novels with even the merest taint of pop lit, _Four_ is _The Da Vinci Code_ in a mortarboard. Set at Princeton in 1999, Ian Caldwell (Princeton &#8217;98) and Dustin Thomason&#8217;s (Harvard &#8217;98) novel follows two seniors&#8217; obsession with the _Hypnerotomachia Poliphili_ and the message coded geekily therein.

Honestly, it&#8217;s a pretty good summer read. But there&#8217;s one unwittingly hilarious scene we feel compelled to hate on. Listen in as one Parker Hassett (a character introduced as &#8220;Ivy&#8217;s village idiot, a half-wit from a wealthy family&#8221;) enters the eating club&#8217;s end-of-year party. He&#8217;s met at the door with &#8220;hisses&#8221; from the crowd &#8212; do they still make those? Later, &#8230;

> &#8230; a huge thud comes from below, followed by an explosion of glass.

> Gil hurries for the stairs; we rush down behind him to find a wide puddle of debris. Blood-colored liquid is seeping in all directions, bringing snags of glass with it. Standing at the center of it all, in a perimeter of space everyone else has evacuated, is Parker Hassett, flushed and fuming. He has just thrown the entire wet bar to the ground, shelves, bottles, and all.

> &#8220;What the hell&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Gil demands of a sophomore watching nearby.

> &#8220;He just went off. Someone called him a [dipso](http://www.answers.com/dipsomania&r=67) and he went crazy.&#8221;

> Veronica Terry [Parker&#8217;s date] is holding up the ruffled skirts of her white dress, now fringed in pink and spattered with wine. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been teasing him all night,&#8221; she cries.

> &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; Gil demands, &#8220;how&#8217;d you let him get that drunk?&#8221;

> She looks at him blankly, expecting pity, getting fury. Partygoers nearby whisper to each other, holding back satisfied smiles. &#8230; [Parker is] amidst the hecklers. From the crowd come coos of _Lush!_ and _Drunk!_ and worse. Laughter at the edges of insult.

My _God_! An undergraduate _inebriated_ at a party! We just laughed for an hour. (&#8220;_Lush!_&#8220;) Caldwell and Thomason: _What the hell Princeton are you writing about?_

Did the mean bullies tease you a long time ago? Make you mad, with their touchdowns and chest hair and girlfriends? We know it hurts, guys. But if you&#8217;re going to get revenge by portraying one as a jerk in a novel, don&#8217;t make his crime &#8230; pregaming.
