I knew I didn&#8217;t study enough for the test, but an _F_? Now I&#8217;ll _never_ make the varsity team! Is there anything I can do to make it up? Anything &#8230; at all?

Down, boy! Well, the poll results are in and they are decisive. Professors Adam Cannon and Tamsen Wolff, rising stars at Columbia and Princeton, are now officially the hottest academics in the League. To be honest, we&#8217;re a little disappointed y&#8217;all picked the young thrushes over the silver foxes. (We admit the crop tool might have handicapped Wolff significantly). Hopefully by the time we hit 50, distinguished-hot will have made a comeback.

It was a&nbsp;tense race, with Columbia&#8217;s Janaki Bakhle and Yale&#8217;s Jean Jacques Poucel initially out in front. A shocking mid-game disqualification killed Robin Kelley&#8217;s dreams of victory, while&nbsp;a late surge by Alyssa Apsel wasn&#8217;t enough to close Wolff&#8217;s then-insurmountable lead. (Final tallies are after the jump.)

Thanks to everyone who voted! If you take classes with either Adam or Tamsen, do us a favor and plant one on them for us. And tell them we&#8217;ll be waiting to accept their gratitude.
