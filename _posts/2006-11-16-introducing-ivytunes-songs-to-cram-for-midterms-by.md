<img width="200" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="173" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/ivytunes.jpg" alt="Introducing ivyTunes: Songs To Cram For Midterms By" />Campus bands got it rough. Best case scenario: they open for the big spring concert performer &#8212; in which case everyone just wants them to get off stage so J5 can start. Worst case scenario: they play Thursday night black box shows for an audience of friends who come more out of guilt than fandom. Maybe that&#8217;s why most campus musicians [ditch](http://www.yale.edu/whiffenpoofs/) [instruments](http://www.brownderbies.com/) [altogether](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~aires/).

Toiling away in obscurity,&nbsp;theirs is a quiet fight. And we think it&#8217;s time they got some recognition. (As you know, around here that can be a good or a bad thing.) Introducing **ivyTunes**, our newest feature: an occasional auditing of groups &#8230; with some sort of Ivy tie.

With that massive handicap working against them, most won&#8217;t get past the finely calibrated hammer, anvil and stirrup of our guest reviewer. (More on him later.) But who knows? Maybe we&#8217;ll find some Ivy groups that don&#8217;t suck. We&#8217;ll have MP3s for download, and as always, the hydrochloric acid of our comments section. **First deadline for submissions: Monday, Nov. 27.** Who&#8217;s excited!? It&#8217;ll be like _American Idol_, &#8216;cept with careers to fall back on!

_Want your band to be considered for ivyTunes, or whatever we call it after Apple&#8217;s trademark lawyers find out about this? Email tracks to <ivygate@gmail.com>. Your band must be sorta-kinda Ivy (we&#8217;re <strike>desperate</strike> flexible), and you must be okay with us posting the MP3s for download._
