The editors of the _Dartmouth_ _Review_ may have [said they&#8217;re sorry](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/12/dartmouth_review_offers_peace_pipe_its_fine_theyre_all_friends_now.html) (sort of) yesterday. But if editor-in-chief Dan Linsalata &#8217;07 is really interested in burying the hatche&#8211;er, smoothing things over, he might want to see about changing [the poorly chosen advertisements](http://www.dartreview.com/) that are still up on the paper&#8217;s official site. (That one on the right actually doesn&#8217;t rotate in with the others; we&#8217;re not sure why.)
