<img width="350" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="249" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/cheesesteak.jpg" alt="Penn Fans Angered By Low-Scoring 97-74 Win" />The Quaker faithful who showed up in full force for Penn basketball&#8217;s home opener on Saturday didn&#8217;t just come for the game. They came for the cheesesteaks.

A fan-favorite promotion holds that everyone in attendance gets free cheesesteaks from local joint Abner&#8217;s whenever Penn scores 100 points at home &#8212; and when you&#8217;re playing woeful Division II opponent Florida Gulf Coast, that&#8217;s a distinct possibility.

Granted, these are the worst cheesesteaks in Philadelphia, but they&#8217;re free nonetheless. Unfortunately, Florida Gulf Coast&#8217;s coach, Dave Balza, has also heard about this little promotion &#8212; so with his team down by 23 points late in the game, he decided to run down the clock and prevent Penn from reaching the century mark. Penn&#8217;s coach, Glen Miller, responded by sending his starters back in to run up the score, but in the end, Penn recorded a measly 97 (a 23-point victory), prompting boos and hisses from the stands.

**Also noteworthy from the Red and Blue Crew cheering section:** a banner that read &#8220;Thank you for making us Penn&#8217;s 2nd worst opponent &#8212; Dartmouth.&#8221; Mean! Meaner: it&#8217;s not true; Dartmouth is actually worse than Florida Gulf Coast. The Big Green are statistically the worst team in college basketball so far this year, losing all three of their games by an average of more than 31 points.
