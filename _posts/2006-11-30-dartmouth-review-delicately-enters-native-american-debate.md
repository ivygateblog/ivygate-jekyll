Tensions over Native American marginalization have been [brewing](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/upset_dartmouth_athletics_director_is_on_the_warpa_wait_bad_idea.html) for some time. Do you a) ignore the issue, b) address it as delicately as possible, or c) publish a [3,500-word philippic](http://www.dartreview.com/archives/2006/11/28/nads_on_the_warpath.php) accusing the offended group of hypersensitivity and self-victimization inside an edition the cover of which depicts an Indian holding aloft a scalp?

If you picked (c), congratulations. We hope you enjoy your time on the [_Dartmouth Review_](http://www.dartreview.com/) editorial board.

Slow clap, fellas. Way to alienate everyone who might maybe have agreed with some of your points. Any reasonable points you [may](http://www.dartreview.com/archives/2006/11/28/nads_on_the_warpath.php) have made have been vaporized.

Members of Native Americans of Dartmouth (a student group with an unfortunate acronym) protested <strike>outside the _Review_ offices</strike> at Dartmouth Hall&nbsp;yesterday. The AP [quotes](http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2006/11/29/dartmouth_rallies_for_minority_students/) President James Wright telling the crowd:

> &#8220;Like an open wound Dartmouth is hurting &#8212; we have all been insulted. &#8230; My Dartmouth, our shared Dartmouth, is one that condemns the deliberate mean-spiritedness that was demonstrated in the publication that was released yesterday.&#8221;

What did Daniel Linsalata, the piece&#8217;s author, have to say about the complaints by American Indian students, after such vivid condemnation across the board for his insensitivity? &#8220;They&#8217;re out for blood, so to speak.&#8221; _Zing!_ Take that, Geronimo! Now go weave Dan some rugs.
