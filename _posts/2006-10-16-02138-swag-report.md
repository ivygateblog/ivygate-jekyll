> Someone who was recently named to 02138&#8217;s Harvard 100, and whom I know well, just received a care package from 01238, including:&nbsp; a bottle of Glenmorangie single malt scotch, some Molton Brown shower gel courtesy of British Airways, a six month membership in some kind of concierge service, an invitation to test-drive a Maybach, and a letter mistakenly addressed to fellow Harvard-100er Samantha Power.&nbsp; All courtesy of 02138&#8217;s advertisers.&nbsp; Apparently, all those named to the Harvard 100 were sent the same package.

So do you think the direct marketing will work on Bill Gates? Will John Roberts lather up with some eucalyptus shower gel? We bet Pete Seeger will take the Maybach for a spin. Whatever it is, W. probably won&#8217;t be touching the scotch.&nbsp;
