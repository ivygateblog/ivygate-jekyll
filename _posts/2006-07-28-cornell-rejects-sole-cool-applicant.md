Assuming this kid really did get rejected from Cornell, it&#8217;s a shame. The people of Ithaca have nothing but humor to keep them warm, and Jamal (his name, according to the comments) clearly drops some at the 62-second mark. 

Maybe if he&#8217;d written his essay on slow motion barbecue fight dancing?
