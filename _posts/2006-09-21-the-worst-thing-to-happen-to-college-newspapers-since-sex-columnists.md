<img width="348" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="101" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/collegepublisher1.jpg" alt="The Worst Thing to Happen to College Newspapers Since Sex Columnists" />Last week, we brought you Penn readers&#8217; [&#8220;truly terrible,&#8221; &#8220;horrific,&#8221; &#8220;godawful&#8221;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/upenn_student_paper_insists_beauty_is_on_the_inside.html) reviews of dailypennsylvanian.com&#8217;s redesign. Some of you have been asking: How did the _DP_, a reliably damn good paper, screw up so bad?

By signing up with College Publisher, a near monopolist in the field of putting college newspapers online. The _Crimson_, _YDN_, _Dart_, _Prince_ and _Sun_ all have indie sites. And while their looks [don&#8217;t always go over so well](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/cornellgasm_continues_apace_the_suns_new_look_bombs.html) themselves, everything College Publisher touches turns to [blocky](http://www.dukechronicle.com/), [ad-infested](http://www.browndailyherald.com/) [dreck](http://www.gwhatchet.com/).

Penn&#8217;s daily isn&#8217;t the only student paper to get hit by the ugly truck. Thanks to College Publisher, it&#8217;s a&nbsp;pile-up. The _Columbia Spectator_ [signed on](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/) this summer, and &#8212; oh crap, here we go again. Some sample comments at the _Spec_-sniping [Bwog](http://bwog.net/):

  * &#8220;horrible&#8221;
  * &#8220;go[d]forsaken shit&#8221;
  * &#8220;an embarrassment&#8230;it&#8217;s not like you have to design a whole new one, just use the old templates. anything that was up before was far, far better. or will your new masters at collegepublisher not let you?&#8221;
  * &#8220;cheesy, childish &#8216;collegepublisher&#8217; ticker up top&#8221;
  * &#8220;college publisher is what every school uses and frankly it sucks. not to mention the new site has like a billion adds. it looks like a yahoo homepage circa 1998&#8221;
  * &#8220;dumb dumb dumb&#8221;
  * &#8220;get rid of it and college publisher NOW while it&#8217;s summer and no one notices&#8221;
  * &#8220;awful. &#8230; Just stop this little project now before you get in over your little heads&#8221;
  * &#8220;At least the old look had some class&#8221;

Ouch! We know IvyGate isn&#8217;t the belle of the ball, but can&#8217;t they these guys take a&nbsp;cue from their&nbsp;[hot cousins to the west](http://www.stanforddaily.com/)? Them Stanford kids code some fine-ass HTML.
