It means you got promoted, got accepted, got married &#8212; some happy event that merits a small but boldfaced mention that all your friends will see. Emphasis on that &#8220;usually.&#8221; Because we&#8217;re betting that Zac Frank, Columbia &#8217;05, isn&#8217;t thrilled about this note in the Sept.-Oct. issue of _Columbia College Today_:

> &#8220;**Sunny Hwang** reports a **Zach** [sic] **Frank** sighting on television: &#8220;While watching _The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency_ on the illustrious Oh! network, Zach was on TV with a special friend. The male models of Janice&#8217;s agency were doing a 2(x)ist underwear event, and Zach was loving it. The show repeatedly cut back to him to show his looks of awe and wonderment. They even showed him and his special friend touching one of the models and asking about the &#8216;material.&#8217; Go, Lions!&#8221;

(For the record, a good-natured Zac says, the &#8220;special friend&#8221; was his boyfriend, Dan Billings &#8217;06.)
