Their humor is risky to the point of self-harm, their pranks are wicked (apparently they got the _YDN_ to [review](http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=21088) a fake modern art show), and their performances &#8212; usually in lecture halls &#8212; are famous for the free flow of substances.

A little background, if you care (if not, skip down to the next graf): They started off as a sort of anti-comedy comedy group after at least one of the founding members didn&#8217;t get into The Fifth Humour. In a 2002 _Yale Herald_ piece, founder David Fabricant &#8217;04 [described](http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxxii/11.02.01/ae/p11.html) his audition: &#8220;I was asked to do a little improv &#8230; so I pulled down my pants, wrote all over my body with a Sharpie, and screamed about how I couldn&#8217;t get laid. They asked me to stop and, needless to say, didn&#8217;t give me a callback.&#8221; But now the group has achieved its own kind of selectivity. As they tell auditioners on their [website](http://www.yale.edu/suite13/about.html): &#8220;Suite 13 is not _Seinfeld_, _Monty Python_, or _McSweeney&#8217;s_. Suite 13 is fucked up.&#8221;

Long story short, the Yale brass must have caught wind (or actually smelled) that a show was in the works, prompting a Suite 13 member to send out this sad announcement:

This is a crime beyond all reason. We actually had the privilege of catching a Suite 13 show in the fall of 2003 in august Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall; we&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s possible to hotbox a lecture hall with 30-foot ceilings, but the audience gave it the ol&#8217; Eli try.

The show was a solid A performance even before the final, jaw-dropping sketch: &#8220;3rd Grade Geography Class,&#8221; where cast members playing schoolchildren had to take shots of Jack Daniels every time they missed a question. Except every time, the teacher would offer to go one-for-one, until by the end he had consumed maybe a dozen shots, plus shotgunning two beers in a finale that had the lecture hall _on its feet_. MADD, you may address complaints [here](mailto:max.broude@yale.edu); just know that it was Awe. Some.
