As far as guilty pleasures, there&#8217;s nothing we&#8217;re looking forward to more than _The Gates_, a [new soap opera](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/the_young_and_the_overeducated.html) about life at Columbia. (Harvard has been enjoying the nation&#8217;s first college soap, &#8220;Ivory Tower,&#8221; off and on since 1984.) Armchair philosophy? Check. Frat brawls? Check. Lesbian love scenes? Check. The show debuts this Thursday night at 9 p.m. on CTV. We&#8217;re doing our best to get a YouTube-able version to watch here, but in the meantime, we&#8217;ve got a few screenshots after the jump to tease your parched palette.

Craigslist really does make everything easier, doesn&#8217;t it?
