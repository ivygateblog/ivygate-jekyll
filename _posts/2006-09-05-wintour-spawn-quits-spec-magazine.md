Shaffer, Columbia &#8217;09 and spawn of _Vogue_&#8216;s Anna Wintour, is quitting as features editor of the new _Spectator_ magazine just days before its Thursday launch, a Columbia tipster tells us. After the [_SoaP_-level](http://www.gawker.com/news/natasha-lyonne/remainders-natasha-lyonne-roams-free-188761.php) [hype](http://www.bwog.net/index.php?page=post&article_id=1796) surrounding Shaffer&#8217;s involvement in _The Eye_, we&#8217;re kinda miffed. As are,&nbsp;no doubt,&nbsp;the _Spec_ staffers who&#8217;d been drafting pickup lines for casual newsroom use (&#8220;I see angels wear Gucci. Get it? &#8216;Cause it&#8217;s like the devil wearing Prada, but only&nbsp;&#8230; What do you mean, &#8216;That&#8217;s all&#8217;?&#8221;).

Shaffer didn&#8217;t reply to our e-mail, but word has it she didn&#8217;t split because of any editorial friction. She just decided she&#8217;s not that into journalism. Which might be [for the best](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=P8&xml=/fashion/2006/04/05/efbee05.xml).

UPDATE 2:02 p.m.: An _Eye_ editor says Shaffer is still involved with the magazine as Special Projects Editor &#8212; in charge of a semester-long project to produce a special shopping/fashion/gift guide towards the end of the year.
