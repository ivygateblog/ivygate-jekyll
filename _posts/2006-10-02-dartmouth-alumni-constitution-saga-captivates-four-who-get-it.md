If you haven&#8217;t been following Dartmouth&#8217;s constitutional battle royale (and we&#8217;re guessing at least 7/8 of you haven&#8217;t), all you really need to know is: It&#8217;s complicated. But in case alumni infighting is your favorite pastime, here&#8217;s the gist:

Back in 2005, Dartmouth de-recognized the Zeta Psi frat for releasing a newsletter detailing the sexual preferences of specific female students. Many conservative alumni considered the move a free-speech infringement. A handful of these alums decided to run for election to the board of trustees, with the free speech issue as part of their platform (other policies include a greater focus on undergraduate life and defense of frats and sports teams). In the spring, the Dartmouth Alumni Association canceled the board vote and introduced a revised constitution, which makes it harder for petition candidates to get elected. Critics say this new version is intended to keep &#8220;outsiders&#8221; off the board. A lot of people claim it&#8217;s not an issue of left vs. right &#8212; the _Dartmouth Review_ and the _Dartmouth Free Press_, normally opponents, have both condemned the proposed constitution. But still, that&#8217;s how it looks, as conservative bloggers have [seized](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDdhZDlhZmE1ZTRiODUyYTI5NGU0YTUwOGMxMDVmOTk=)&nbsp;this&nbsp;[chance](http://powerlineblog.com/archives/015279.php) to fight academia&#8217;s &#8220;entrenched liberal hierarchy&#8221; or whatever you want to call it. (_The Dartmouth_, which [endorsed](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006092202010) the constitution, is gonna kill us for &#8220;politicizing&#8221; the&nbsp;debate like this. We tried not to, really!) Over the next month, alumni may call in and cast their votes.

Got all that?&nbsp;Us neither.&nbsp;Sensing a similar ignorance across all of Dartmouthland, one anti-constitution group has resorted to the global tonic of YouTube. Problem is, THE VIDEO WAS JUST TAKEN DOWN! For violating &#8220;terms of use&#8221;!! Can someone please explain??

In the meantime, here&#8217;s this absurdist, suspiciously high-budget&nbsp;get-out-the-vote promo:&nbsp;
