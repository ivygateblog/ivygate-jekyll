  Last week, <em>Crimson</em> editors <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515456">published</a> a note announcing that two staffers suspended for plagiarism, cartoonist Kathleen Breeden &#8217;09 and columnist Victoria Ilyinsky &#8217;07, will be able to reapply for their jobs next semester. Not exactly a reinstatement, but it does display the editors&#8217; commitment to healing, not just purging.

  But not all is tranquil at 14 Plympton.&nbsp; Breeden claims that <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515504">only one</a> of the four cartoons at issue (the one <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/the_crimson_cartoon_look_really_close_maybe_you_can_spot_the_similarity.html">ripping off</a> <em>Newsday</em>&#8216;s Walt Handelsman) was bogus; <em>Crim</em> president William Marra&#8217;s investigation says she <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515456">jacked two</a>. Someone&#8217;s wrong &#8212; but hey, who&#8217;s counting? Group hug!

  The whole flap has been so absurd &#8212; 3 a.m. face-saving deals, a nation of cartoonists drawn into conflict, Breeden volunteering to <em>take a polygraph</em> &#8212; that maybe everyone&#8217;s just glad it&#8217;s quietly going away.

  MEANWHILE &#8230; Back at the university, Harvard has <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515461">licensed</a> antiplagiarism software from Turnitin.com and plans to roll it out one department at a time. Can we buy some Class A shares in that company?
