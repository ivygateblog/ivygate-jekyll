_More irrefutable proof that stuff happens at Cornell &hellip;_

ITHACA, N.Y. &#8212; Tucked into the north corner of Cornell&#8217;s sprawling campus is [Risley Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risley_Hall), a special programs dorm dedicated to the arts. It&#8217;s basically a frat, but with easels: Risleyites have their own building (a castle, really), they throw decadent theme parties, and they have shloads of sex, usually with each other. As with any fraternal organizaiton, there&#8217;s an undisputed hierarchy, but this one has little to do with seniority. Rather, it&#8217;s all determined by the [Risley Purity Test](http://risley.ascetics.net/test/).

Anyone can take the test. But to score well &#8212; i.e., to have an extremely low purity level &#8212; one must explore the building&#8217;s every orifice, get nekkid in a kiddie pool, sleep with other Risleyites (here the algorithm gets complex), and, if you aspire to mythical status, push the boundaries of the test itself (see the stunning &#8220;Extraordinary Historical Events&#8221; section, most of it inappropriate for a family blog). Your score on the test determines your rank, be it plain old Risleyite, RisMilitiaman, RisNinja, Rear Admiral of Risley, Starchild of the Kommittee Funkadelic Allstars, RisDeity, or (the highest possible honor) Godot!.

Ultimately, the Purity Test isn&#8217;t just a promiscuity scale. It&#8217;s a measure of one&#8217;s commitment to the Risley experience. Of course, what&#8217;s a Risley experience without a good ol&#8217; triple-fisting in the building&#8217;s dungeon-like bowels?
