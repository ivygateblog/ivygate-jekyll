_A Dartmouth tipster writes in with news from Hanover&#8230;_

Not two weeks ago, Dartmouth sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma was put on &#8220;extended probation&#8221; &#8212; and 11 of its members arrested &#8212; after it was discovered that becoming a sister at the vaunted house entailed participating in an initiation process that can only be described as &#8220;blackout rollerskating.&#8221; (The official response from Kappa prez Whitney Dickerson &#8217;07: &#8220;Kappa Kappa Gamma opposes inappropriate or illegal use of alcohol by its members.&#8221; Ms. Dickerson is evidently fine with inappropriate use of alcohol so long as imbibers are fastened to little plastic wheelies.)

In that fateful year, a few innocent bystanders &#8212; one of whom may or may not have been in a wheelchair &#8212; happened to get trampled, and the fun-killers who populate the upper ranks of the school&#8217;s administration put the kibosh on the whole thing by threatening to slap any scramblers with a trespassing charge. Old traditions die hard at Dartmouth, and now drunk upperclassmen simply hurl invectives at drunk freshman to take matters into their own hands. Sometimes they do:
