_The following episode of the **IvyGate Index**&reg; has been rated WTF for strong language and a graphic depiction of a complete lack of Ivy dominance._

[<img width="200" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="90" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/ivygate-index-logo2.jpg" alt="The IvyGate Index: Hollywood" />](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/ivygate_index/)Welcome to the third (and probably final) installment of the [IvyGate Index&reg;](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/ivygate_index/), our hyperscientific gauge of Ivy influence in arbitrarily chosen fields. This time: Hollywood! Are you ready for your close-up?

To measure Ivy dominance of the film industry, we sicced our in-house team of Nobel number crunchers on the 78th Annual Academy Awards. We knew it was a gamble: Hollywood is not the Ivy slumber party that, for example, [the media](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/the_ivygate_index_calibrating_hegemony_since_2006_1.html) and [the executive branch](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/ivygate_index_the_executive_branch.html) are. But how bad could it be? Movies are important &#8230; and nothing&#8217;s more important than the Ivies &#8230; so we should totally own these jokers, right?

Not so much. For the top 12 Oscar categories, a grand total of one (1) bona fide Ivy League diploma walked trophy-ward across the Kodak Theatre stage.

Why, it&#8217;s &#8230; it&#8217;s almost as if an Ivy diploma is overvalued in this context! Sean Penn, _auto mechanics major_ at Santa Monica College? Say it ain&#8217;t so! We cry a single tear as we inform you that Hollywood&#8217;s IGIQ (IvyGate Index Quotient) is a box office bust at exactly **12 percent domination**. Slap me Pappy, it&#8217;s pie chart time:

_ **Verdict:** What have you won for us lately, Natalie Portman?

Soldier on past the jump, if you&#8217;re able, for notes on methodology; disinfect all surfaces after handling raw data.

_Methodology: 1.) Given the barnyard beating that the Ivy League was taking at the hands of the civilians, we chose not to count each member of the &#8220;It&#8217;s Hard Out Here for a Pimp&#8221; trio as a separate winner.&nbsp; 2.) Reese Witherspoon was arbitrarily deemed a &#8220;legacy&#8221; Ivy Leaguer; see raw data above. 3.) Though tempting, no points were bestowed for Rachel Weisz&#8217;s (Best Supporting Actress, &#8220;The Constant Gardener&#8221;) Cambridge degree; suck it, England._
