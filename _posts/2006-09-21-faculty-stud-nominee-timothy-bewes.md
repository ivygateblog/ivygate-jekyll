The hottie nominations have been rolling in, and we&#8217;re so&nbsp;thrilled with the responses that we couldn&#8217;t resist sharing. This love letter comes from Brown alum and [blogger](http://fishunderwater.blogspot.com/) Jaime, &#8217;04:

> &#8220;Somewhere between hot-hot and distinguished-hot is British-hot, and at the top of that list is Brown University&#8217;s William A. Dyer, Jr. Assistant Professor of the Humanities and Assistant Professor of English, Director of Undergraduate Studies Timothy Bewes.&nbsp; I took the first class he ever taught there (&#8220;What Was Postmodern Literature&#8221; &#8211; does the pretension have you hot already?), when he was still a visiting lecturer.&nbsp; Soon after he was asked to stay on, because too many students were too damn in love with his seductive British stammer.&nbsp; (He&#8217;s also a freaking amazing teacher, but whatever.)
> 
> &#8220;He&#8217;s tall and thin, and at first you think he&#8217;s a stammering tweedy Brit, all erms and ahs, and it&#8217;s really cute and great to listen to when he&#8217;s lecturing.&nbsp; But then he starts to relax, and his lectures get more passionate.&nbsp; But still with the Brit stammer, of course, because it&#8217;s still so goddamn sexy.&nbsp; And as winter approaches, he trades his brown sportscoats for this surprisingly badass leather bomber jacket.&nbsp; And as you spend the afternoons gazing at him, you notice &#8211; he&#8217;s got an ear pierced.&nbsp; And is that a small scar from a former nose ring??&nbsp; Add to all this that he&#8217;s a freaking <span class="c2">Marxist</span>, and he&#8217;s an Ivy League wet dream.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think there was a single person in my class (originally planned for about 12 students, but ended up around 50 because everyone who went the first day fell in love, and Brown loves pomo) who didn&#8217;t go to office hours with the secret (or not-so-secret) hope of sweeping all the papers off his desk and&#8230; well, you know.
> 
> &#8220;It&#8217;s been more than three years since the class, and I&#8217;m still totally in love with him.&nbsp; If I had taken his class a little earlier (I was a junior) I&#8217;d have been an English major just so he could be my advisor.&nbsp; I think I really mean that, too.&#8221;

Keep them coming! Direct all love to <ivygate@gmail.com>. If your pitch is as convincing as this one, we&#8217;ll unleash it upon the world.
