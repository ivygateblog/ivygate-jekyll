A team of Brooklyn-based Yalies and other miscellaneous Ivy-types have started what may well be the world&#8217;s first online sitcom: [Duder](http://www.dudershow.com). Although the terrible name is probably setting off alarm bells of lameness for some of you, judge not too quickly! The three episodes posted so far are actually pretty hilarious. Plots: sturdy. Production values: impressive. Comic timing: competent to inspired. We&#8217;ve come to appreciate the show&#8217;s Seinfeld 2.0 themes and delightful awkwardness &#8212; the show&#8217;s take on interracial dating in episode one, shown below, is guaranteed to have you squirming.

So here&#8217;s to you, Duder. You&#8217;re proof that we don&#8217;t all have to become [stunningly](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/you_cant_take_it_with_you_unless_you_do.html) [mediocre](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/draft.html) [tools](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/come_for_the_free_smirnoff_stay_to_smash_the_bottle_over_some_popped_collars_head.html) after we graduate.
