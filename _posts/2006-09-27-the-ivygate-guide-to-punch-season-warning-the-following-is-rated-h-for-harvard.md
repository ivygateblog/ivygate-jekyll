You&#8217;d think that at a progressive-minded institution like Harvard, the symbols of pre-WWII masculist inheritocracy would be long abolished, or at least neatly swept under the rug.

Nope. Harvard&#8217;s social Rosh Hashana arrives in October with &#8220;punch season,&#8221; a frenzy of schmoozing, flattery and backstabbing that, for a lucky few, results in election to one of Harvard&#8217;s selective &#8220;final clubs.&#8221;

Quick translation for non-Harvard kids: Final clubs aren&#8217;t quite like Princeton&#8217;s eating clubs, though members may eat there. They&#8217;re not quite like Yale&#8217;s secret societies, though they are secretive. They&#8217;re not quite like Dartmouth&#8217;s frats, though they&#8217;re essential to the party scene. Their privately owned clubhouses range from sweet to jaw-dropping. Thirty years after Harvard went co-ed, they remain single-sex. And most importantly, while you can &#8220;comp,&#8221; or pledge, publications like the _[_Lampoon_](http://www.harvardlampoon.com/)_ or the&nbsp;[_Advocate_](http://www.theharvardadvocate.com/), final clubs come to you.

Why do we care about punch? Think of it this way: the entire process, from the scandal to the secrecy to the [backlash](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=504616), encapsulates everything we love and hate about the Ivies. We plan to follow the process closely this year, starting with this here textbook-length primer: the **IvyGate Guide to Punch Season**.
