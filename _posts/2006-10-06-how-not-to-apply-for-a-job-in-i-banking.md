**UPDATE:** YouTube has [removed the video](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/calling_aleksey_vayners_bluff.html); we&#8217;ve replaced it with a Veoh clip below, or you can download the file here.
  
**UPDATE 2:** Turns out that serving up the enormous video file blew the roof off our server. We&#8217;ll let Veoh host for now, and re-host it if they take it down.

Imagine you&#8217;re a recruiting director at an investment bank. Aleksay&#8217;s resume come across your desk. The &#8217;07 Yalie&#8217;s stuff seems normal enough, until the link to [a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjRZgmc3RyQ) at the end. Twenty-four hours later, you&#8217;re the laughingstock of New York, the newest viral sensation. We&#8217;ve been forwarded his stuff a couple times, and the email suffixes tell the whole story: Greenwich Capital Markets, Credit Suisse, Wachovia Securities, JP Morgan, Lazard, on and on and on.

He&#8217;s ours&#8221; &#8230;

Here&#8217;s a link to Vayner&#8217;s [official site](http://www.alekseyvayner.com) (what&#8217;s with the weird must-be-over-18 warning?), and his original [cover letter and resume](http://www.ivygateblog.com/images/vayner.pdf). _[Ed. note: We rushed this online as soon as we got it, only to notice [Dealbreaker.com](http://www.dealbreaker.com/2006/10/how_not_to_apply_for_a_banking.php) had it a little while ago. The headline overlap was accidental, seriously.)_ **UPDATE:** Read more of IvyGate&#8217;s [wall-to-wall coverage of Aleksey Vayner](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/aleksey_vayner/)!
