After a week of Camp Yale and a week of classes, you&#8217;re tired of entryway parties. But with the [CONSTANT TERROR OF ANNIHILATION](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/new_haven_gets_that_much_lovelier_1.html), you still need a drink to steady your nerves. Off campus, New Haven is a [minefield of humiliating establishments](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/shalek_commits_horrible_breach_of_eli_trust.html), so we offer this idiot&#8217;s guide to the Have&#8217;s diamonds in the rough:

**BAR**
  
Don&#8217;t be fooled by the contrived, minimalist name. BAR is a solid choice for an evening out. They brew their own beers and the pizza gives Peppe&#8217;s and Sally&#8217;s a run for their money. Unless you&#8217;re the kind of freshman who runs the floor Xbox network, you should know by now that Thursdays at BAR are a keystone of the Yale social scene. Only Freestyle Dueling Association members and DSers whose Kant papers are due Friday at 9 can afford to miss it.

**Rudy&#8217;s**
  
Many would call this New Haven&#8217;s best bar, and they&#8217;d almost be right (see next entry). Rudy&#8217;s has it all: genuine Yale memorabilia, surly bar staff, and townie punks who hate you and everything you stand for. Bring a good fake though, because the bouncers are pros and they&#8217;ll keep your McDougall Street ID before you have a chance to tell them who your father is.

**Anchor**
  
The sleeping giant of the Elm City bar scene. The vaguely nautical decor is effortlessly hip. Anchor is known as a bit of grad student hangout, so it&#8217;s a great place to watch your TAs at play. The only mistake you can make there is getting stuck in the overflow space (the &#8220;Mermaid Room&#8221;) in the basement, which is too reminiscent of a rapist&#8217;s rec room to be any fun.
