**BREAKING NEWS ALERT:** At 11:25 p.m. IvyGate received a communique from a person or persons claiming to be Josiah Stinkney Carberry, the reknowned Brown professor of [psychoceramics](http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/libs/hay/carberry.htm), and evidently the mastermind behind the [kidnapping of the Penn Quaker](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/brown_kidnaps_penn_mascot.html). As proof of life, Prof. Carberry submits the above photo (click to enlarge) of the Quaker with a recent edition of the _Brown Daily Herald_, followed by a list of demands. The dispatch, in full:

> Drum Major [Brian] Phillips [&#8217;07],
> 
> To indicate that you are willing to negotiate for the life of your beloved
  
> Quaker, the Penn Band must play the Brown fight song during the fourth
  
> quarter of the Penn vs. Brown football game this Saturday. And Cheeseman
  
> must wear brown socks. We will have a representative present to observe.
> 
> Should you choose to ignore this request, the Quaker will suffer.
> 
> Brown Division of Hostage Negotiations

We don&#8217;t know what the Penn marching band policy is re: negotiating with terrorists. But Phillips, my God, man, look what they&#8217;re capable of. We urge you to comply, or better yet, retaliate:

**UPDATE:** This is too funny not to include. From a Deadspin commenter: &#8220;It puts the lotion on its foam&#8230;&#8221;
