Just ask Harvard&#8217;s _Scene_, a training-wheels _Vanity Fair_ [minus](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510382) the [journalism](http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2005/12/03/harvard_glossed_over/?page=1). Let us turn our collective attention to Princeton&#8217;s upcoming [_Oh-So-Fresh Magazine_](http://www.ohsofreshmag.com/new/index2.html) (please, _O.S.F._), a &#8220;lifestyle and entertainment&#8221; publication with a rather unfortunate name. Guys: How can you possibly expect to avoid &#8220;douchebag&#8221; remarks _when you call your magazine &#8220;Oh So Fresh&#8221;?_

In an [interview](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2006/12/06/news/16882.shtml) with the _Princetonian_, editor-in-chief Harrison Schaen &#8217;08 describes it as &#8220;a combination of _GQ_ and _Rolling Stone_.&#8221; So far, so good. But suddenly, as if hit by the hyperbole truck, he starts unleashing quote after [Vayner](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/aleksey_vayner/)-worthy quote:

  * &#8220;When I was in high school, I said to my friends, &#8216;By the time I&#8217;ll be 21, I&#8217;m going to start a revolution.&#8217; &#8220;

  * &#8220;You have to have your &#8216;in,'&#8221; Schaen said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about what you know, it&#8217;s about who you know. We know who to talk to. We know executive heads, we know producers, and that&#8217;s how _OSF_ serves as the medium between the University and the entertainment world.&#8221;

  * &#8220;What sets us apart is our contacts,&#8221; Schaen said. &#8220;We have contacts with MGM, Sony and Paramount, as well as major record labels. It&#8217;s all about getting your name out there and having someone who matters look at you, and that&#8217;s what we intend to do with _OSF_ magazine.&#8221;

We hope, for the sake of everyone involved, the _Prince_ reporter botched these quotes. Even Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Paul Muldoon, a Princeton prof contributing a piece to the first issue, fails to say anything substantive: &#8220;Universities have to be alert to what&#8217;s happening in the world,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The academy is about making sense of the world. What else are we to make sense of? And the world is very varied.&#8221;

We know starting a publication is no small feat &#8212; you gotta commend Schaen a hundred percent for that. But a friendly word of advice: Pick up a publicist when you hire the rest of the staff. (Wait, we just re-read the _Princetonian_ piece. You already have a publicist. _You already have a publicist for your undergraduate magazine?_ On second thought, maybe that&#8217;s the problem.)
