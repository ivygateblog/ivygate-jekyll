How many Ivies? [Not a one](http://www.mensfitness.com/college_rankings/79).

We&#8217;d like to say this surprises us. But considering how many of our physical achievements in college can be measured in gallons, we don&#8217;t expect&nbsp;other Leaguers to pull their collective (ahem) weight.

But it does raise the question: Which is the _fittest_ Ivy? Columbia&#8217;s carton-a-day habit would certainly make it the skinniest. Penn was probably the leanest a couple days ago, thanks to Yom Kippur fasting. And Yale&#8217;s on-demand gourmet cuisine makes it the most well-fed. But the fittest? We have to go with Dartmouth. Any school whose orientation involves mountaineering and [eating bugs for a week](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/dartmouth_trekkers_prepare_for_lives_of_solitude_cannibalism.html) deserves the title.
