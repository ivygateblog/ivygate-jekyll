Hey, Yale _Herald_ guys &#8212; congrats on the mention in the education issue of the _New Yorker_! We think.

Is that a good or bad thing? Eh, Sarah Raymond can probably use it to get laid at a lit mag party. Meanwhile, our friend [Duke Obsrvr](http://dukeobsrvr.com/) landed this quote in the same issue&#8217;s long piece on the [Duke maybe-rape scandal](http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060904fa_fact):

> A sharp-eyed campus social critic, the widely read anonymous blogger known as DukeObsrvr, summed up the men&#8217;s lacrosse team&#8217;s place in the social hierarchy this way: &#8220;Let&#8217;s not kid ourselves, what frat doesn&#8217;t hate these fuckers? The lacrostitute is a notch higher on the social scale than the &#8216;frat slut.&#8217; And dammit that&#8217;s something worth fighting over.&#8221;

So, yeah, maybe not so illustrious a week for the student writer set.
