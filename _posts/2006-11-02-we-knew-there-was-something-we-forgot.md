We are so, so sorry. A reader informs us we&#8217;ve been ignoring the youngest Ivy, that great staple of the Ithacan skyline: Cornell. Somehow we&#8217;ve ended up posting more about Dartmouth lately. Dartmouth! From an AIM&nbsp;convo last night:

> [redacted]: why is there nothing about cornell? are we just not newsworthy?
  
> ivygateblog: we are so sorry.
  
> ivygateblog: we know.
  
> ivygateblog: tell us filthy gossip!
  
> [redacted]: _i guess that&#8217;s the sad thing._
  
> [redacted]: _there isn&#8217;t any filthy gossip. we live at the library. we study._

We do our best to give every Ivy equal love and attention, honest. But it would really help us out if something, you know, _happened_ there.

So here&#8217;s our challenge: Prove to us that things occur at Cornell. Check out how broad that is: Things. That occur. For the next week, we&#8217;ll lower our standards from rock-bottom to subterranean; deluge us with tips [here](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com), and we&#8217;ll make it back to Ithaca, even if it takes us as long as [this dude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus).
