<img height="207" hspace="10" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/corrections.jpg" width="140" align="right" border="0" alt="When Wordplay Attacks" />Here&#8217;s an amusing lede from Wednesday&#8217;s _Brown Daily Herald_ piece on [roller derbies](http://www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/09/27/Features/Providence.Roller.Derby.Part.Of.Sports.National.Revival-2310623.shtml?norewrite200609291128&sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com):

> &#8220;It&#8217;s a Friday night in Providence, and techno music plays in the background as scantily clad girls are getting smashed. Nearby &#8230;&#8221;

Get it? Smashed? &#8216;Cause it&#8217;s a roller derby? Well, somewhere at the _Herald_ is a [way-too-literal copy editor](http://www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/09/28/Corrections/Correction-2313848.shtml?norewrite200609291128&sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com) who didn&#8217;t get the joke.

> &#8220;Due to an editing error, an article in yesterday&#8217;s Herald (&#8216;Providence Roller Derby part of sport&#8217;s national revival,&#8217; Sept. 27) incorrectly stated that a _Herald_ reporter witnessed attendees at a recent Providence Roller Derby event &#8216;consume copious amounts of alcohol.&#8217; The _Herald_ reporter did not witness such activity.&#8221;

Join us next time, when the copy desk informs us there were [no actual bears](http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/09/29/Sports/More-Than.Bragging.Rights.On.Line.In.Footballs.Uri.MatchUp-2316934.shtml?sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) on the football field this weekend.
