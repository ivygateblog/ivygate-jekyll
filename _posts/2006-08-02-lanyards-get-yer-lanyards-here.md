Almost as much as if there were a Dartmouth<sup>TM</sup>-brand fishbowl available for purchase. Please, spend some quality time on the site &#8212; as far as we can tell there&#8217;s absolutely no difference between the Ancient Eight and a Manalapan, N.J., summer camp. In particular, let&#8217;s go through the &#8220;Ivy League Day Camp Means Big League Fun!&#8221; welcome message, sentence by sentence, just to make sure it&#8217;s true:

**&#8220;Campers come to IL for the fun!&#8221;** And the rigorous academics. Check.

**&#8220;We want campers to be the BEST THAT THEY CAN BE in a safe and nurturing environment.&#8221;** Check (except Columbia, which is about as nurturing as [Cronus](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Goya_-_Saturno_devorando_a_su_hijo.jpg)).

**&#8220;All of our facilities and activities are age appropriate.&#8221;** At Brown you can eat Tom&#8217;s of Maine toothpaste for dinner and then have a three-way. Nothing is age-inappropriate. Check.

**&#8220;At IL campers make friends and discover opportunities for belonging in our camp community.&#8221;** Check. Making lanyards, holding someone&#8217;s hair over the toilet, it&#8217;s all the same.

**&#8220;Discovery, exploration, active participation and respect for others, are the elements of ILDC.&#8221;** You&#8217;ve heard of &#8220;Bi now, gay later?&#8221; Yeah, check.
