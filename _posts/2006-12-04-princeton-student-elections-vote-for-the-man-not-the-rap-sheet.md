At most schools, student government types can be written off as self-important and kinda silly. At Harvard, for example, one campaign has a spokesperson who writes [&#8220;embargoed&#8221; press releases](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/12/harvard_student_elections_please_struggle_to_care.html). But don&#8217;t you dare dismiss the undergrad politicians at Princeton: they&#8217;re street-hardened criminals as scarred as they come.

Okay, not quite. These guys haven&#8217;t done time or anything, but by Ivy standards they&#8217;re tough mofes. Presidential candidate Grant Gittlin &#8217;08 has been forced to live off-campus (a rare punishment) after three disciplinary violations &#8212; and that was while serving as Class of 2008 president. But those [MIP](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mip)-type jobs are tame compared to his opponent, Rob Biederman &#8217;08, who&#8217;s been accused of _setting a squirrel on fire_.

Sorry, squirrel _carcass_. Biederman [claims](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2006/12/01/news/16814.shtml) he was &#8220;more of a bystander&#8221; than a &#8220;driving force&#8221; in the squirrel-burning, which he calls a &#8220;non-issue.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a single person on the USG who doesn&#8217;t do silly things from time to time,&#8221; he told the _Princetonian_. Yeah, chill out guys, it was dead.

Frankly, it sounds like these guys are qualified _because_ of their pasts, not despite them. Gittlin says he got university president Shirley Tilghman&#8217;s go-ahead to run for USG prez even after his disciplinary history. Biederman also had some administrative face-time as the squirrel embers were cooling, and apparently no formal action was taken. These are guys who know the university inside and out and inside again. May the gangsterest man win!
