Daily News</em> Expos&#233; Blows Lid Off Columbia's Hardcore Curriculum" />To hear the <em>New York Daily News</em> tell it, Columbia students barely have time to go to lecture, what with all the naked parties, library sex, and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/474805p-399293c.html">classroom demonstrations of cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails sadomasochism</a> going down at every turn.</span> A breathless and alternately outraged/pervy Douglas Feiden tells every sordid detail of the &#8220;X-rated&#8221; &#8220;playpen for sexual hijinks&#8221; that is &#8220;Columbia Gone Wild&#8221; &#8212; the anal sex broadcast on campus TV, the workshop for &#8220;kicking and trampling&#8221; sex &#8230; it&#8217;s Sodom and Gomorrah U!

It&#8217;s in the _Daily News_, so it&#8217;s gotta be true. But just to make sure, we polled some friends in Morningside: How often _do_ Columbia kids get laid?

  * &#8220;once every six months. **columbia is a rough world for single people**.&#8221;
  * &#8220;the average in the engineering school is probably like **once a semester**&#8220;
  * &#8220;i would say within the first week of a new class, then consistently for 3 weeks, **then it would get ugly**&#8220;
  * &#8220;either I missed out or everyone else in college **isn&#8217;t having sex at all**.&#8221;
  * &#8220;i can&#8217;t make a funny comment about it at the moment&#8230;i&#8217;m too tired. **watching 5 episodes of veronica mars in a row has exhausted me**&#8220;
  * &#8220;I&#8217;ve kind of got a girl right now, but **we&#8217;re both too busy to actually have sex**. I think a lot of people are in my boat, and they deal with it by commoditizing and scheduling time for sexual pleasure as they would a meeting with their adviser&#8221;
  * &#8220;Random hook-ups do happen, but it is probably rare for most students. At night people just go back to their rooms and finish their homework or **maybe heat up a hot pocket**&#8221;&nbsp;

Oh. Well then. As for the truthiness of the rest of Feiden&#8217;s story, maybe one of our ex-girlfriends put it best. &#8220;i can honestly say that neither me nor anyone i know has ever participated in S and M at this school,&#8221; she IMed. &#8220;unless you count having sex in a twin XL bed as pain.&#8221;
