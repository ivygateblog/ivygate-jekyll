<img width="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="375" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/calc.jpg" alt="Ivy League B-Schools Kinda Pointless" />Despite having no idea what actually goes on during business school (our only clues have been through [YouTube](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/you_know_how_they_say_we_only_use_10_percent_of_our_brains_i_say_we_only_use_10_percent_of_excel_functionality.html)), attending one has always seemed like a good idea. You finish undergrad, self-loathe through Teach For America and McKinsey for a little while, then coast on into B-school. Ka-ching! MBA = instant six-figure salary!

Then we saw _BusinessWeek_&#8216;s [annual rankings and roundup](http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/06/index.html?chan=bschools_bschool+index+page).

**Bad:** The Ivies land one measly prof out of 23 in their [&#8220;My Favorite Professor&#8221;](http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/favorite_profs/index_01.htm) feature, Rich Curtis of Cornell.

**Worse:** Chicago nabs the [No. 1 rank](http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/06/full_time_tables/mba_main.htm), thwarting Wharton at No. 2.

**Absolutely terrible:** In [&#8220;The High Price of Admission,&#8221;](http://bwnt.businessweek.com/bschools/06/mba_payback.asp) _BW_ calculates how long it takes to earn back the money B-schoolers spend on tuition, taking into account their average before-and-after salaries. Ivies in the top 10 values: none. Ivies in the bottom 10: Harvard, Penn, Columbia and Dartmouth. What gives?

> The likes of Wharton and Harvard tend to attract high earners, making it harder to get a big salary bump at graduation and recoup the investment in an MBA. How hard? For Harvard grads, the breakeven point won&#8217;t come until 2020, or about 20 years shy of retirement.

Getting carpal tunnel from Excel, dressing up for class all the time, paying back loans for 14.44 years &#8212; remind us why B-school is worth it again?
