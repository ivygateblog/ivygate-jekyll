But the true measure of success is whether you&#8217;ve inspired a hate-blog.

Miriam Datskovsky &#8217;07, the _Columbia Spectator_&#8216;s sex columnist (and opinion page editor), knows what we&#8217;re talking about. She&#8217;s been penning her column, &#8220;Sexplorations,&#8221; going on two years now. During that time she&#8217;s taken plenty of flak, like this [scorcher](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/04/28/Opinion/Spitting.It.Out-2027312.shtml?norewrite200610310017&sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com) that she ran on her own opinion page, but nothing has rivaled the meticulous vitriol of [Fire Miriam Datskovsky](http://firemiriam.blogspot.com/). It&#8217;s a new blog so anonymously, obsessively hateful it kind of twists in on itself and, by the eighth sentence-by-sentence dissection of Datskovsky&#8217;s published prose, starts to read like a tribute. (Bwog&#8217;s burbling [comment section](http://www.bwog.net/index.php?page=post&article_id=2537) is afire on the topic; it&#8217;s alternately hilarious and ad hominem.)

It&#8217;s true, Datskovsky is edging into Natalie Krinsky territory with her [vanity site](http://www.miriamdatskovsky.com/). But she&#8217;s been pretty good-natured about taking heat. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a problem with the Fire Miriam blog,&#8221; she told us.&nbsp;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s great people are taking the time to comment extensively on why they don&#8217;t like my writing.&#8221; (As for Bwog, she says they didn&#8217;t contact her for comment before posting.)

Consider yourself lucky, Miriam &#8212; after hate-blogs come book deals.

(Full disclosure: We&#8217;re biased. Half of us had drinks with Miriam once and she is, for the record, a sweet, unpretentious gal.)
