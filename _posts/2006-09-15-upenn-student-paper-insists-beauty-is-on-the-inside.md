<img height="76" hspace="10" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/makeover.jpg" width="180" align="right" vspace="10" border="1" alt="UPenn Student Paper Insists Beauty Is On The Inside" />The _Daily Pennsylvanian_ is conducting a Project Runway of sorts, asking readers to [weigh in](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticleComments&ustory_id=fee1eec3-a41b-4aa3-804c-47796ed5e5ca) on their web site&#8217;s new look. And what do Philadelphians have to say?

  * &#8220;possibly the WORST transition to a new site I have seen&#8221;
  * &#8220;Seriously terrible&#8221;
  * &#8220;Truly terrible&#8221;
  * &#8220;Absolutely terrible&#8221;
  * &#8220;very 1997&#8221;
  * &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding. This new site is horrific. ADS ADS ADS, what is the daily run by whartonites now?&#8221;
  * &#8220;The format is also godawful. No easy way to find articles and read them, which is the primary purpose of you know, having them online.&#8221;
  * &#8220;Your site used to look professional&#8221;
  * &#8220;a step backward&#8221;
  * &#8220;Good typeface.&#8221; _[Ed.: Outlier!]_
  * &#8220;I&#8217;m all for creative change but this one looks as if the committee couldn&#8217;t decide on a look so all ideas were incorporated. It&#8217;s horrible, jumbled and messy. The first time I experienced the new look, I thought it was a pop-up that my blocker failed to catch. It&#8217;s offensive to the eye.&#8221;

To be fair, not all readers agree. For example, while one said the site &#8220;looks like some high school kid&#8217;s idea of a newspaper website,&#8221; another reader said it was more like middle school. (Also, &#8220;cluttered, ugly, and ad-laden.&#8221;) This is almost as bad as [Cornell](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/cornellgasm_continues_apace_the_suns_new_look_bombs.html).
