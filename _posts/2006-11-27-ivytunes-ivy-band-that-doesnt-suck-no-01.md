Our critic has the mic:_

There&#8217;s nothing I like more than spending a sunny, unseasonably warm weekend in front of my laptop, headphones on, listening to MP3 after MP3 of incompetent rock, rap and [shudder] folk &#8212; especially when those MP3s were created by coddled, over-credentialed Ivy Leaguers like myself. Except, perhaps, ripping off my arm and clubbing myself to death with it.

So a big shout-out to all the acts that participated in our first ivyTunes cattle call. The only thing worse than being Nickelback is paying $40,000 a year to pretend to be Nickelback &#8212; and we here at IvyGate think that such a monumental achievement deserves a little recognition. Thankfully, you generous souls have provided me with enough material &#8212; white rappers, a cappella side projects, cellos &#8212; to last for weeks to come. I eagerly await the opportunity to crush your dreams.

A few of the MP3s I received were &#8220;not horrible.&#8221; A few were &#8220;listenable.&#8221; And one or two were actually &#8220;good.&#8221; The best of the bunch: Filligar, (pronounced &#8220;fill-uh-gurr&#8221;), a Chicago-based quartet featuring brothers Pete, Teddy, and Johnny Mathias, and fourth-wheel Casey Gibson. Pete and Teddy go to Dartmouth. They&#8217;re 19. Johnny, the singer, is only 17. Teenagers or not, Filligar is remarkably mature &#8212; they&#8217;ve got that crucial blend of pop precision and effortless weirdness down pat. The new CD is called &#8220;Succession, I Guess.&#8221; It&#8217;s hardly dangerous stuff &#8212; fellow yupsters (and Chicagoans) Wilco would be proud. But it&#8217;s not like Ivy Leaguers are particularly strong in the sex and drugs departments anyway. One out of three ain&#8217;t bad.
