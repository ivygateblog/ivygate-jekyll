  * <span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so careless, I&#8217;ve left my security badge on for the entire Metro ride home.&#8221;</span>
  * <span>&#8220;God, I was at the office so late &#8212;</span> <span>Really big bill, you know, I think it has a good chance &#8212;</span> <span>I guess I just won&#8217;t change before the kegger in Henle 505. Guess I&#8217;ll just wear this button-down shirt, untucked, sleeves rolled up. God, is my badge still on? So embarrassing!&#8221;</span>
  * <span>&#8220;Oh, you work for Tom Davis? Virginia &#8230; 10th, right? Tommy? Tom-Tom? Tom&#8217;s <em>nuts</em>! Anyway, committee staff or personal? That&#8217;s cool, I work in Dirksen.&#8221;</span>

And they _still_ get laid. The city of Southern efficiency, Northern hospitality and [Ninth Circle interns](http://www.snopes.com/computer/internet/tripplehorn.asp) never ceases to amaze us. Rucker&#8217;s piece &#8212; an evergreen at the <span class="c1">Post</span>, which runs one each August &#8212; is lively enough reading, but it lacks that certain <span class="c1">je ne sais puke</span> we believe all features on coffeefetchers should have in spades. Judge them, Rucker! Judge them and their badges!
