_This being the [Year of the College Blog](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/year_of_the_college_blog_begins_now.html) and all, we thought we&#8217;d examine the other sad faces around the Ivy blog bar. Introducing **Blog Man on Campus**, our occasional Ivy bloviation spotlight. First up, a few wonky jokers from Cambridge, care of our correspondent &#8230;_

Its mascot looks like a dapper Batman villain: a bowtied fly clutching a martini. With this intimidating muscle behind it, Harvard&#8217;s **Gadfly** &#8212; written by Adam Goldenberg &#8217;08 and Peter Mulcahy &#8217;07 &#8212; doesn&#8217;t shy from tough arguments, be it &#8220;[Romney&#8217;s an asshole](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/gadfly/2006/09/07/its-official-romneys-an-asshole/),&#8221; or &#8220;[Princeton: Our Bitch](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/gadfly/2006/09/18/princeton-our-bitch/).&#8221; It was briefly integrated into the _Crimson_&#8216;s online Opinion section, where the writers delivered some [hearty finger-wagging](http://www.thecrimson.com/blogentry.aspx?blogID=35&ref=161) about the _Crimson_&#8216;s recent plagiarism &#8220;scandal,&#8221; and some [even heartier finger-wagging](http://www.thecrimson.com/blogentry.aspx?blogID=35&ref=173) at the paper&#8217;s assumption that non-_Crimson_ people care (to this last assumption, we also [plead guilty](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/harvard_crimson/)).

But the blog isn&#8217;t stuck in Cambridge; it also plumbs the [nuances](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/gadfly/2006/09/12/bringing-down-the-house/) of the early admissions process in the Ivies, ponders the [fate](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/gadfly/2006/08/16/all-the-kings-horses/) of Lebanon, and has a [chuckle](http://www.thecrimson.com/blogentry.aspx?blogID=35&ref=160) at Mizzou&#8217;s Kenneth Lay-endowed chair in economics.

If the bleached-out look is burning your corneas, check out their podcasts. If Goldenberg&#8217;s Robert Siegel voice doesn&#8217;t win you over, maybe Mulcahy&#8217;s relentless deadpan will. That is, if it doesn&#8217;t drive you into a rage (when there&#8217;s audio, it&#8217;s like being condescended to in person). The podcasts cover topics in a lot more detail; [here&#8217;s](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/gadfly/2006/11/21/and-again/) their take on former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami&#8217;s visit to the university, complete with discussion of the latter&#8217;s justification of the death penalty for homosexuals.&nbsp;

A recent post described Harvard&#8217;s blog scene as &#8220;withering away and dying.&#8221; Keep the dream alive, fellas.
