You may have noticed that we&#8217;ve been edging into hibernation mode for about a week now, with one or two posts a day as our version of [metabolic depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation).

Now all goes dark until January. Not sure about you all, but we plan to spend our holiday rediscovering the joys of going to sleep sober. May your chestnuts roast evenly, may your ironically intended gifts be received as such, and may you return with eggnog-soaked tales with which to stuff our inbox.

See you in the new year!
