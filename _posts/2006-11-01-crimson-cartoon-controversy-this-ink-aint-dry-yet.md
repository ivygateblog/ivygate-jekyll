Were we too hasty Sunday in [calling](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/the_crimson_cartoon_look_really_close_maybe_you_can_spot_the_similarity.html) Kathleen Breeden of the _Harvard Crimson_ &#8220;a Kaavyariffic, Jaysontastic, Glasstacular staffer who has boldly pushed the frontier of plagiarism to cartooning&#8221;? The _Crimson_ has suspended the artist and [publicly apologized](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515368) to those whose work she allegedly appropriated &#8212; but now some professionals are [defending Breeden](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515394), saying that &#8216;toonists use the same visual ideas all the time.

> &#8220;If one guy draws a cartoon, he&#8217;s a genius. If two guys draw a cartoon, one&#8217;s a plagiarist. If five guys draw it, they&#8217;re hacks, and if 10 guys draw it, they&#8217;re following a grand tradition,&#8221; [comics heavy Daryl] Cagle said, citing an industry joke. &#8230; &#8220;Put half the fault on [her] editor, and let the cartoonist develop her own voice,&#8221; Cagle said, adding that cartoonists frequently generate the same idea independently.

Cagle has more on [his blog](http://www.cagle.msnbc.com/news/blog/) (scroll to Oct. 30):

> TAKE THE CAGLE CHALLENGE &#8230;
> 
> I can take any reputable cartoonist and find cartoons that are similar to his cartoons, drawn earlier by other cartoonists, that make as good a plagiarism argument as the case being make against this poor student cartoonist.

Fair enough, this guy&#8217;s an expert. Kim Jong Il&#8217;s hair as [mushroom](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/hairbreeden.jpg) [cloud](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/hairoriginal.gif) &#8212; maybe no ripoff there. But note that in every instance, Breeden&#8217;s work is dated way after the alleged source. And come _on_:

Yeah, we&#8217;re gonna wait on that retraction.
