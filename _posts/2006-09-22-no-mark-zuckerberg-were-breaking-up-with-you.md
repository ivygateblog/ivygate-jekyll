Dear Mark,

Wow. We believed all those groups that claimed &#8220;Facebook Is Watching You,&#8221; but this is just&nbsp;&#8230;&nbsp;wow.

Two weeks ago, we started a Facebook profile for IvyGate. Sure, we tiptoed around some of the FB bylaws (our last name isn&#8217;t actually &#8220;Blog&#8221;; we&#8217;re not the spitting image of Kaavya Viswanathan),&nbsp; but for the most part, we were legit. We quietly amassed a pile of friends, we started a [group](http://facebook.com/group.php?gid=2209648968); it was a good life. Then we tried to log on, and found this:

<img width="136" vspace="0" hspace="10" height="230" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/zuckerberg.gif" alt="No Mark Zuckerberg, <em>We're</em> Breaking Up With <em>You</em>!" />We&#8217;ve tasted the [bitter fruit of rejection](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/dan_golden_whispers_sweet_nothings_in_our_ear.html) before. But from you? Is this really the time to be driving people [away](http://www.ivygateblog.com/facebook/) from Facebook?

See, the problem, Mark, is that you know the power of exclusivity. It&#8217;s what made you. Without Harvard, you&#8217;d be Friendster. But you played it right. You slowly eased the reins, letting in first the other Ivies, then the New England colleges, then the rest, until every student in America recognized your eerie, silkscreened mug peering out from atop their browsers. Now that you&#8217;ve [invited everyone into the hot tub](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/in_lieu_of_flowers_please_send_pokes.html), forgive us for saying your inclusivity feels a little &#8230; calculated.

So no, we&#8217;re not breaking up. We won&#8217;t let you. We&#8217;ll be back. And by God, you&#8217;re the first person we&#8217;re friending.

Te amo,

IvyGate
