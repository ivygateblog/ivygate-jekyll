How&#8217;d they do it? Uhh, through Facebook, obvi.

It&#8217;s amazing. There&#8217;s &#8220;People who hate the facebook facelift&#8221; (16,794 members), &#8220;Students against Facebook News Feed (Official Petition to Facebook)&#8221; (89,284 members),&nbsp;and &#8220;Facebook looks shit now&#8221; (1,679 members). You can also sign the online petition [here](http://www.petitiononline.com/faceb00k/petition.html), or suck it up and sever your social spinal cord on Facebook Boycott Day. Of course, no one would have ever HEARD of these brave efforts were it not for the new features that make us all stalkers &#8212; and stalkees &#8212; whether we like it or not. (Overeager friendsters are paying the price: Now the whole campus knows when you quietly remove _Footloose_ from your list of favorite movies.)

Congratulations, Facebook. You&#8217;ve given us the greatest organizational tool since the truncated yak horn. Too bad its first use had to be protesting you.
