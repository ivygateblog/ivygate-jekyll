Now" />Prophecy is pretty sweet. Just ask Princeton&#8217;s Bernard Lewis &#8212; guy has a <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flash4.htm">hunch</a> the Middle East will evaporate by Labor Day. If he&#8217;s right, people will call him the next Nostradamus. If he&#8217;s wrong &#8230; no one will notice.

  So, in the same spirit of devil-may-care, we offer our own prediction: We hereby declare 2006-07 <strong>The Year of the College Blog</strong>. Not those whiny blogs with Dashboard lyrics and black-and-white photos of skinny girls looking out windows. We&#8217;re talking about blogs people will read instead of the student paper. Blogs you visit to get notes from the class you missed. Blogs with photos from the party you weren&#8217;t invited to. If all this happens, then maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; bloggers will become the new BMOCs.
