You know, the kid who raises his hand just as class lets out and goes, &#8220;Teacher, you forgot to give us homework!&#8221; Now that they&#8217;ve eliminated early admissions, everyone else has to grudgingly follow suit. Today Princeton became the [second school](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2006/09/18/news/15829.shtml) to scuttle the policy.&nbsp;Admissions officers are working the spin, but we know what they&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Everyone could have gone along, nice and easy-like, accepting half the class early&#8211;if only those dummies hadn&#8217;t piped up.&#8221; Look forward to Princeton kids&nbsp;pulling out the trusty&nbsp;&#8220;First is the worst, second is the best&#8221; defense.
