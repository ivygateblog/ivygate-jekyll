The next Kaavya!_ That&#8217;s the shrill-ish noise we&#8217;re hearing from Cambridge, after the _Crimson_ ran an editor&#8217;s note yesterday apologizing for an Oct. 16 [column](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514975) by Victoria Ilyinsky &#8217;07. The column bore some similarities to [a Slate piece](http://www.slate.com/id/2129105/) on misuse of the word &#8220;literally.&#8221; The relevant passages (via Steve Melendez &#8217;07 and his blog, [Rabbits and Robots](http://ftp.campustap.com/Home.aspx)):

From _Slate_:

> As is often the case, though, such &#8220;abuses&#8221; have a long and esteemed history in English. The ground was not especially sticky in _Little Women_ when Louisa May Alcott wrote that &#8220;the land literally flowed with milk and honey,&#8221; nor was Tom Sawyer turning somersaults on piles of money when Twain described him as &#8220;literally rolling in wealth,&#8221; nor was Jay Gatsby shining when Fitzgerald wrote that &#8220;he literally glowed,&#8221; nor were Bach and Beethoven squeezed into a fedora when Joyce wrote in _Ulysses_ that a Mozart piece was &#8220;the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.&#8221;

From _The Crimson_:

> Not only is &#8220;literally&#8221; one of many misleading terms, but it&#8217;s also had multiple meanings for quite a while. The third aforementioned quote-&#8220;the land literally flowed with milk and honey&#8221;-comes straight from Louisa May Alcott&#8217;s 1868 novel &#8220;Little Women.&#8221; And who doesn&#8217;t remember Fitzgerald&#8217;s description of Jay Gatsby: &#8220;He literally glowed?&#8221; But neither was the town of Plumfield overrun with food-stuffs nor our favorite social climber actually luminescent.

Melendez notices how Ilyinsky makes the same points about &#8220;Janus words&#8221; and &#8220;contranyms&#8221; as the _Slate_ writer and emerges unsympathetic:&nbsp;

> My conclusion is that Ilyinsky plagiarized [_Slate_&#8216;s] Sheidlower; of course, she may not have started writing with that intent, but it looks like that&#8217;s what happened.

Honestly, we&#8217;re not so sure. Ilyinsky definitely ganked the _Slate_ author&#8217;s ideas with no attribution whatsoever. But there&#8217;s a line between honest mistake and you&#8217;ll-never-work-in-this-town-again plagiarism/fabulism. We say Ilyinsky falls, with a couple inches to spare, on the honest-mistake side. The bigger sin is lazily revisiting tired subject matter that&#8217;s been treated in a classic David Cross routine, [this blog](http://literally.barelyfitz.com/), and every pop grammar book ever. (IvyGate reserves the right to flip out if more infractions come to light.)
