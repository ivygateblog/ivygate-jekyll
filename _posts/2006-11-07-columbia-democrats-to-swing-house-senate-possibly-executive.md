If the nation&#8217;s Democratic machine were anything like Columbia&#8217;s, they probably wouldn&#8217;t even bother holding midterms. In a good way! CU Dems have campus on such lockdown that even the College Republicans are [supporting Lieberman](http://media.www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/11/03/Election/College.Republicans.Ignore.Party.Lines.To.Campaign.For.Lieberman-2438156.shtml?sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com).

This weekend, Columbia Dems [ferried](http://media.www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/11/03/Election/College.Democrats.Return.To.Ohio-2438155.shtml?sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) the usual busloads of students out to the battleground state of Ohio, where Democratic challenger and golden boy Sherrod Brown (also father of Columbia senior and poll-tested cutie Liz Brown) leads in the polls. Blog-happy _Spec_ reporter Jimmy Vielkind [embedded](http://blog.columbiaspectator.com/) himself with the caravan and continues to file dispatches from the road.

Our favorite moment comes on the bus ride when a volunteer decides to ditch the group and go hiking instead:

> &#8220;We stopped in [Paterson, N.J.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson,_New_Jersey), where someone defected,&#8221; Lamata said. &#8220;I guess the phone call was something like, &#8216;Hey, are you in New Jersey at a gas station? I&#8217;m like 20 minutes away. Do you want to go hiking?'&#8221;

Maybe we take back that part about the machine.
