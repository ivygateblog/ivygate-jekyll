&#8220;Congratulations, you have a sex column! Here&#8217;s a number where you can commission a photographer and web designer, and here&#8217;s a thesaurus for the male genitalia. You can start making eye contact with your father again in four to six years!&#8221;

When you sign up to be a sex columnist, is there one centralized madam who hands out a one-size-fits-all publicity kit? We just came across the web site of one [Jessica Gold Haralson](http://www.jessicagoldharalson.com/), Penn&#8217;s resident &#8220;sex-positive feminist&#8221; and &#8220;intellectual pervert&#8221; (okay, we kinda like that), and it&#8217;s a clone of almost every other Carrie Bradshaw wannabe&#8217;s. Below, compare pale Haralson to [embattled Datskovsky](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/dont_sex_columnists_get_off_on_this_kind_of_attention.html) and their esteemed colleague, the Washingtonienne:

Yes, that actually does read &#8220;Ivy League-r. Out of yours.&#8221;

What do you think, should we redesign our site too?
