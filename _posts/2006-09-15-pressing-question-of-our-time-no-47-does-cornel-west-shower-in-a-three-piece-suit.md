Princeton Professor Cornel West likes to talk. And we (unless we&#8217;re on a sick streak in Text Twist) like to listen to him.

So naturally we flipped out upon learning that our favorite [theologian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornel_West)/[actor](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rv_cmp/rv_bios_west.html)/[MC](http://www.amazon.com/Sketches-Culture-Dr-Cornel-West/dp/B00005OC67) would join 111 other &#8220;thinkers&#8221; at Dropping Knowledge, a day-long talk-a-thon held in Bebelplatz, Germany and moderated by Willem Dafoe. Basic idea: a hundred questions are read out loud, one by one, with about two minutes for the participants sitting around a massive roundtable to deliver answers into their personal webcams.

In West&#8217;s case, the result is 100 two-minute lectures on everything from God to biodiversity to the linking of machinery and the human brain. (We always knew _The Matrix: Reloaded_ would come in handy!)

Anyone who hasn&#8217;t survived a Cornel West lecture needs to watch, like, three of these, and you&#8217;ll get the idea. Time really flies &#8212; West&#8217;s propensity for stream-of-consciousness sermonizing means each two-minute segment is only about three sentences long.

Money quote: Personal freedom is &#8220;people having the right to their own nonsense as long as they don&#8217;t engage in injurious harm to others. The right to believe what they want. To live a life, even if it appears nonsensical and ridiculous to others.&#8221;

A better summary of Cornel West&#8217;s career has yet to be found. Watch the videos [here](http://www.droppingknowledge.org/bin/home/home/true.page).
