What a time to work for a daily Ivy newspaper. The semester&#8217;s about to start, you&#8217;ve spent all summer relaxing with a leisurely weekly publication schedule, and you just can&#8217;t wait to get after that breaking news!

But &#8230; what&#8217;s that noise, you ask? That stinging sensation? Oh, nothing, it&#8217;s only Laura McGann [bitch-slapping the shit out of you](http://newsinitiative.org/story/2006/08/15/studying_students). The Northwestern (graduate) journalism student scooped the national press in mid-August, when sh&#8217;all was sleepin&#8217;, by revealing that the federal Department of Education has been sharing data from hundreds of student loan applications with the FBI for almost five years. McGann&#8217;s blockbuster story (it got red-faced pickup in the [Chronicle of Higher Ed](http://chronicle.com/free/2006/08/2006083105n.htm) yesterday and the [New York Times](http://chronicle.com/free/2006/08/2006083105n.htm) today) sets the bar for investigative student journalism, topping David Zhou&#8217;s [Kaavyabomb](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512948) in the Crimson last semester.

Tough act to follow, Ivy reporters. And you&#8217;re supposed to be tops in the game. Looks like you&#8217;ve got your work cut out for you!
