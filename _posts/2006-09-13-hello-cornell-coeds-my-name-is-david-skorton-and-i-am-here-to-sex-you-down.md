And he just don&#8217;t stop.

We knew Cornell Super-Prez David Skorton could play mad jazz sax straight Clinton-style. What we didn&#8217;t know is he rocks the jazz flute just as hard, in the proud tradition of one Ron Burgundy. (Sorry for the videophone quality.)

This begs the question, could Skorton nail Veronica Corningstone?

Clearly, Skorton&#8217;s number is lacking in the flamethrowing department.

You stay classy, Ithaca.&nbsp;
