Two anonymous Dartmouth alums write in this week with a brilliant guide to the Hanover Greek scene. Don&#8217;t go to Dartmouth? Read anyway, out of respect to the men and women whom [history alleges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_pong) invented beer pong. Yesterday: [Fraternities](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/more_than_you_ever_wanted_to_know_about_the_dartmouth_fraternities.html).

<u>**Sororities**</u>

  * **Kappa**: Dartmouth Kappas, for the most part, fit the national rep: popular, obviously pretty (a fine distinction between genuinely pretty), and dominantly blonde. Trademarks include: runny nostrils, visible ribs, and overblown sense of self-worth (one Kappa was quoted in the _Dartmouth_ last year saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m a Kappa, because it&#8217;s like being permanently in style.&#8221;)&nbsp; Nevertheless, Kappas are the social queens of campus. A contingent of NYC private school types usually fronts each class; that these girls are the more bearable of the lot says bundles about the relative merit of everyone else. Fun fact: Despite its hot-girl, &#8220;We eat carrots and date Heorots!&#8221; status, Kappa actually has the largest underground lesbian community of the sororities.&nbsp; The women&#8217;s soccer and hockey teams both have locks on the rush process, and so the girl-on-girl action quietly filters through year after year.&nbsp; Makes for a dynamic bus ride come formal time.
  * **Tri Delt**: Tri harder.&nbsp; Every once in a while, a decent, socially adjusted girl slips through the ranks and ends up having to suffer the indignity of being associated with a bunch of cookie-cutters (literally and figuratively). But for the most part, Tri Delt is a personality graveyard. Most recently, Tri Delt was the subject of a campus-wide scandal after pledges were forced to perform faux stripteases on a bunch of Theta Delts. &#8220;At Tridelt we wear pearls/ribbons/Reeboks&#8230;we sometimes &#8216;do lunch.&#8217; We&#8217;re seriously awesome,&#8221; notes a recent recruitment letter without a shred of irony. The walking embodiment of _Jane Magazine,_ if it suffered from Down Syndrome.
  * **KDE**: Party girls without any of the trendy Kappa coke cachet. KDEs equate female empowerment with trying to drink and cavort like a bunch of frat boys, despite the fact that no one takes them seriously. Sisters here have mastered the fine art of talking shit behind one another&#8217;s backs while pretending everything&#8217;s all peachy face-to-face. (At least the animosity is out in the open in Kappa.) Perhaps the most irritating sorority, if for no other reason than you can&#8217;t attend a party without seeing a bunch of KDEs trying to suck the remaining foam out of a tapped keg like thristy dogs lapping at a dripping faucet.
  * **Sigma Delt**: Deferred KDEs. Lots and lots of lesbians dressed up as &#8220;rowers&#8221; and &#8220;rugby players&#8221; and &#8220;swimmers.&#8221; Have an activist, feminista vibe going on, which, when combined with the drunk girl-on-girl vibe, makes for a lively house right in the middle of Hanover Town proper.&nbsp; The fun comes during rush, when innocent non-lesbian females are recruited in droves. Somehow, despite the overabundance of short hair and the palpable exuberance of having a new crop of girls in the room, no underclassman ever seems to pick up on the joke, unless she is already on Team Lesbian, in which case she&#8217;s going to join the house anyway.&nbsp; Not that any recruit ever has a problem with it, but the &#8220;Holy shit, I thought they were just good FRIENDS&#8221; bit is truly entertaining.
  * **Alpha Xi**: Discarded Tri Delts.&nbsp; Fun fact: they live in the former Beta fraternity house, which stopped being the Beta House when closed-circuit cameras (affectionately known as Beta-vision) used for broadcasting sexual exploits were discovered. This has absolutely nothing to do with Alpha Xi, but bears mentioning.
  * **Theta**: A total mystery. Out on the scene as often as Pynchon and Salinger. Rumored to be kinda weird and slutty, though, which isn&#8217;t an altogether bad reputation.
  * **Alpha Phi**: Brand spankin&#8217; new, which means if you end up a sister here, you&#8217;d have been better off not rushing in the first place.
