> &#8220;This is Scott Ward. I&#8217;m not in the office and will not be for some time. Please email me &#8230; &#8220;

Not for some time, eh? No, [we](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/3adb20e8eada3?in_archive=1) [should](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/3adb1fc0649af?in_archive=1) [think](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/3adb1f388d57a?in_archive=1) [not](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/08/28/44f3830b44824). And, uh, Scott &#8212; they probably don&#8217;t have email where you&#8217;re going, either.

UPDATE 11:44 p.m.: Wait, wait, we totally have a better punchline! Q: How many UPenn Emeritus Professors of Marketing does it take to screw in a lightbulb? A: One, to be charged with corruption of a minor, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, solicitation to commit prostitution, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional stress, negligence, fraud, statutory rape, indecent assault and indecent exposure over a 12-year period. Um, in a lightbulb.
