The weather is changing; you&#8217;ve got a slate as blank as your new Five Star<sup>TM</sup> notebooks. You&#8217;re taking an exciting Harold Bloom seminar, that cute Kevin might ask for a date, and maybe you&#8217;ll even try out for OH MY GOD WEST NILE VIRUS IN NEW HAVEN!!

As if everyone&#8217;s favorite urban hellscape wasn&#8217;t charming enough, it&#8217;s now a cesspool of disease-carrying mosquitoes, the YDN <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=32987" target="_blank">reports</a>. <span>Two New Havenites have been diagnosed, including one fatality, and on Thursday a new case was reported in nearby West Haven. Some quick IvyGate math tells us that means a) there&#8217;s a <em>50 percent death rate</em> and b) THE TERROR IS SPREADING.</span>
