Oh, wow. While anxiously and one-handedly Googling stuff like &#8220;ivy league blog,&#8221; hoping to see our yearling site turn up in the results, we came across [IvyLeagueBlog.com](http://www.ivyleagueblog.com). Title: &#8220;Poverty Sucks&#8221;; subtitle: &#8220;A blog for the unashamed.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the charming first post:

> You are fortunate enough to have stumbled across **IvyLeagueBlog.com**, a blog like no other.&nbsp;
> 
> It is for those who can sympathize with or are interested in people like myself who lead a better quality of life.&nbsp; It is not an apologist blog, and maybe not for those who cannot understand the need (and can afford) to buy a $4,000 Italian suit for OCI&#8217;s (On campus interviews for those not in the know).
> 
> This site it what it is ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; If you despise this way of life&#8230;well&#8230;poverty sucks, doesn&#8217;t it?

Followup items include &#8220;Heading to the Hamps&#8221; (doesn&#8217;t this guy know the cool kids call it H-town now?) and a recap of an impromptu trip to the Oscars. Mercifully, the blog then died, as so many do, but not before one &#8220;Marc&#8221; added this comment:

> Any Yale grads besides me? Ivy League is everything &#8211; before I went Ivy I was a financial analyst with J&J. Know what that gets you? $40,000 and a Taurus.
> 
> An Ivy education not only pays well, but its the ultimate aphrodisiac &#8211; I can go into any club, drop the Y-bomb, and go home with whatever gorgeous kitten I desire. Whats not to like?
> 
> Shout out to my brother Sig Delts!

Blogging about the Ivies sure puts us in some gooood company, don&#8217;t it? From now on, every reader gets issued a handgun, so we can be sure we&#8217;ll be shot and killed if we ever inch close to that kind of repellence.
