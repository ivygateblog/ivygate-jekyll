</p>

> &#8220;Ruth Bernard Yeazell, the diminutive former chair of the English department. There was nary a day she was not wearing a leather skirt and knee high boots to our Victorian Novel class. It was so appropriate&#8211;all that Foucauldian delight in the repressed, her long silk sleeves buttoned at the cuff, her tight little black sweater vest, and then that leather skirt, those high, enclosing leather boots, her raspy voice. Plus all that Victorian slant-talk about sex, Hardy&#8217;s Tess accepting the ripe strawberry into her virgin mouth, then getting drugged and deflowered in the gloomy wood. Steamy.&#8221;
