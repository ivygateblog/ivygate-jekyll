Brown President Ruth Simmons is richer than Scrooge McDuck. The _Herald_ reports today that [Brown paid Simmons $685,000](http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/09/06/CampusNews/Simmons.Salary.Nears.700k-2258413.shtml?sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) in 2005 &#8212; up almost 20 percent from the year before. Setting aside our temporary confusion over why the school&#8217;s vice president would earn more ($709,000 &#8212; _down_, actually, from $781,000 in 2004), we&#8217;ve done some quick math to see what that kind of scratch buys in Providence &#8230;
