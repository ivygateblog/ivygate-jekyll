This might not seem like that big a deal to seven-eighths of you readers. But think of Cheers becoming a sushi bar, or Moe&#8217;s turning into a French-Asian fusion brasserie &#8212; that&#8217;s the level of upheaval we&#8217;re talking about.

Falling as it did on April Fools Day, news of the Stend&#8217;s demise was greeted throughout Morningside Heights mostly with horrified disbelief, then the apocalyptic rending of garments.

&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to change the essential character of the West End,&#8221; new owner Jeremy Merrin [reassured](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/04/10/News/Rethinking.The.stend-2027607.shtml?norewrite200608271422&sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com) the faithful at the time. &#8220;The big center bar, the benches on the side, the cheap beer, they&#8217;ll still be there. For anyone who walks in, it&#8217;ll be immediately recognizable as The West End.&#8221;

Yeah, see the photo? Not much change there, no sir! There&#8217;s the, um, coatrack Ginsberg probably used at some point, and &#8230; uh &#8230; the bathroom! Barack Obama must have used that at some point. Just oozing history, that place is. Way to homewreck, merry Merrin.

Other, embiggened photos after the jump.
