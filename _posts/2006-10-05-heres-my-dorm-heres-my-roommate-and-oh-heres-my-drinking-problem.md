Hey Mom! Hey Dad! Thanks for coming to visit me here at Brown. Parents Weekend is the best, right? Check out [the schedule](http://brownparentsweekend.rawdata.net/event_schedule.php). They&#8217;ve got stand-up comedy, a &#8220;Mom and Pop Hop&#8221; Swing Dance, Cider on the Green, lots of stuff! Oh, and then there&#8217;s this:

> 10:30 a.m.-noon
  
> Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon meetings.
  
> Open meetings designed for students in recovery at Brown University, and for their family members and friends who are visiting this weekend. We also welcome local members of AA and Al-Anon.

End dramatic reenactment. Are they for real? What parents want to visit their kid, expecting a weekend of three-legged races and a cappella music, only to discover their bundle of joy has become a wino? We&#8217;ve said it before and we&#8217;ll say it again: _This is what happens when you let them design their own curriculum._
