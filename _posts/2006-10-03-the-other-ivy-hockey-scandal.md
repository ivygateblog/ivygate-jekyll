Here is the procedure to get [men&#8217;s ice hockey tickets](http://cornellbigred.cstv.com/sports/m-hockey/spec-rel/082806aaa.html#geninfo) this season:

> &#8220;This year, students must preregister for the ticket sale online and then report to the athletic ticket office to pick up a line number. After the preregistration and number pickup, three drawings will be held to determine the three numbers that will start the graduate/professional, the senior, and the general undergraduate lines. Beginning with the number drawn, the next 200 consecutive numbers of the graduate/professional ticket pool, the next 150 consecutive numbers of the senior pool, and the next 1,250 consecutive numbers of the general undergraduate pool will indicate&#8230;&#8221;

Did you just read that? Neither did we. Something about preregistration and line numbers and the next 150 consecutive somethings and _seriously?_? For _Cornell hockey_, maybe the most insane sporting experience in all the Ivy League? They practically hand out Wild Turkey at the door to Lynah Rink. In other words, you need to be super-organized and on top of all these arcane rules &#8212; in order to act like the gentlemen pictured above. Makes sense.
