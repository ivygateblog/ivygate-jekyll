An IvyGate correspondent, wandering through scenic Cincinnati, stumbled upon this:<img height="394" hspace="10" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/ivygate-lane.gif" width="500" align="top" vspace="10" border="1" alt="Somewhere Near Gawker Ave. And Chronicle of Higher Ed. Blvd. ..." />

It&#8217;s truly humbling to learn that someone named a street after us. Thanks, Cincinnati. And if municipal records suggest they were first, it&#8217;s only cause they knew we were coming.
