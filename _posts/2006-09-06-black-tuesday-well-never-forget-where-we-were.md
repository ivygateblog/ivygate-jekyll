  Sept. 5, 2006. Never forget.

The silver lining &#8212; if the horror of Facebook News Feed can even be said to have one &#8212; is that our generation has finally found common ground. Something to unite us, even in blackest tragedy. There are no red states today, no blue states; the pre-med knows the lit major is his brother, and yea, the state school shall lay down with the private.

Iraq, Katrina &#8212; nothing!! Black Tuesday, as it shall be known in hush&#8217;d sorrow forevermore, is the crucible in which our generation will be forged.
