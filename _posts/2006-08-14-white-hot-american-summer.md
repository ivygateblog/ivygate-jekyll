Blogging for [A Day in the Dartmouth Life](http://dartlife.blogspot.com/), Zak Kaufman &#8217;08 says [Camp Dartmouth](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/further_proof_that_dartmouth_h.html) is way cool: &#8220;It&#8217;s like summer camp, except WE set the rules, and Crazy Camp Director Felix isn&#8217;t there to enforce them.&#8221; (Emphasis, sadly, Zak&#8217;s.) Plus, whereas Felix punished bad campers by taking away all of Mom&#8217;s home-made brownies, it only takes one special brownie to bribe campus police.

Also, Zak&#8217;s photos confirm it: Camp D is Pastefest 2006. There&#8217;s something discomforting about a place so white the number one pickup line is, &#8220;Can you do my back?&#8221;
