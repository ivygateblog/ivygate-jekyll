Hi, I&#8217;m Chris Beam &#8230; and I&#8217;m Nick Summers. And we do&nbsp;IvyGate. We both graduated from Columbia, &#8217;06 and &#8217;05. We&#8217;ve been running this little lawsuit magnet since July, and we figured it&#8217;s time to stop pretending our identities are some big secret.

We know you&#8217;re full of burning questions, like &#8220;What the hell do I care?&#8221; and &#8220;So what?&#8221; We&#8217;re telling you this because some of the stuff we&#8217;ve been covering ([fraudulent megalomaniacs](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/aleksey_vayner/); [intra-paper scuffles](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/harvard_crimson/); [profs we&#8217;d like to tenure, over and over again](http://www.ivygateblog.com/faculty_studs_and_tenured_temptresses_of_the_ivy_league/)) shouldn&#8217;t be done from behind a veil. And we&#8217;re confident enough in the reporting behind our newsier items that attaching our names is just a journalistic no-brainer.

So, I&#8217;m Nick &#8230; and I&#8217;m Chris. Aleksey Vayner, please do not come to our homes and kill us.
