Our critic has the mic:</em>

  Ivy Leaguers tend to come out on top. They pass through the imposing gates of their storied northeastern universities and go on to become presidents, surgeons, CEOs &#8212; even bloggers. But never before have they become the &#8220;best unsigned band in America.&#8221; Until now.

  You heard right, Ivy League music fans. [Crickets. Tumbleweed.] Earlier this fall, Salon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/audiofile/">Audiofile</a> blog invited unsigned acts everywhere to submit previously-unreleased MP3s to its inaugural &#8220;Song Search&#8221; contest. A panel of critics and bloggers then whittled the hundreds of painfully hopeless (trust me) hopefuls down to 10, who competed two at a time&nbsp;over the course of the subsequent five weeks for the votes of Audiofile&#8217;s readership. &#8220;Celebrities&#8221; like Rob Thomas weighed in from time to time, and last week the five first-round winners went up against each other in a bloody, no-holds-barred cage match. And guess who won?

  Bishop Allen.&nbsp;

  <img height="200" hspace="10" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/bishopallen.jpg" width="200" align="right" vspace="10" border="1" alt="ivyTunes: The Mussy-Haired, Reedy-Voiced, Straight-Outta-Cambridge Indie Rock Smackdown" />In case you don&#8217;t know, <strong>Bishop Allen</strong> is a Brooklyn-based indie band beloved by the MP3 blogosphere for its polite, quirky pop and gimmicky plan to release one EP per month for all of 2006. (They&#8217;re two short with 11 days to go. Cram, guys, cram!) To be honest, Bishop Allen&#8217;s stuff doesn&#8217;t bother me &#8212; it&#8217;s well-crafted and charmingly off-kilter, if completely inoffensive and somewhat samey-sounding (listen <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/LikeCastanets.mp3">here</a>). Which was a pleasant surprise considering that BA cofounders <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006437/">Justin Rice</a> (of <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/trying_really_hard_to_hate_andrew_bujalski_1.html">Andrew Bujalski</a> fame) and Christian Rudder graduated from, um, some school up in Boston. Well, in Cambridge actually. No, not MIT. The other one. I mean, look at these people. &#8211;>

  But, alas, nothing gold can stay. Like the good Ivy Leaguers they are, the boys of Bishop Allen, it seems, bent the rules a bit in their quest for world domination. According to <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/audiofile/2006/12/18/song_search_winner/index.html">Salon</a>, &#8220;in what was surely an oversight, the band&#8217;s &#8216;Like Castanets&#8217; had been available for purchase online as part of an EP, and thus contravened the Song Search <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2006/09/25/songsearch_terms/index.html" target="_blank">&#8216;Terms and Conditions,&#8217;</a> which specify that &#8216;the track must not be sold anywhere on the World Wide Web for the duration of this contest.&#8217; &#8221; An oversight, surely. Meaning bye-bye Bishop Allen&#8230;&nbsp;

Not that a whole lot has changed. In a surprise turn of events worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (I mean that pejoratively) the Main Drag is &#8212; spoiler alert! &#8212; also heavy on the Harvard. The winning song, &#8220;Jagged Gorgeous Winter,&#8221; was written by John Drake (recent alum), Matt Boch (senior) and Adam Arrigo (who just graduated from some school called &#8220;Tufts&#8221;). Although the group cites pretty much every cool indie band as an influence &#8212; Arcade Fire, The Books, Animal Collective, Broken Social Scene &#8212; they&#8217;re clearly obsessed (to the point of shameless imitation) with the uncoolest indie band of all: Death Cab for Cutie. Arrigo, the singer, was either born with the same thin, sweet, desperate voice as Ben Gibbard or has labored mightily to perfect his impersonation. Really, it&#8217;s a little eerie. On the plus side, the songwriting is accomplished, the arrangements dynamic and the production packed with smartly skewed electronic elements.&nbsp;

  But the &#8220;best unsigned band in America?&#8221; What say you, commenters?

  (Need more Ivy League indie? Check out The Main Drag&#8217;s sister act, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/blanks">Blanks</a>. They also drop some hip names as influences &#8212; Talking Heads, Prince, XTC and Gang of Four &#8212; but end up sounding a lot like Hot Hot Heat. Still, the expertly assembled &#8220;Pouncer&#8221; and &#8220;Kodachrome&#8221; are many, many cuts above the usual campus-band dreck. Worth a listen.)
