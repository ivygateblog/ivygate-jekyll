This email from a _BDH_ staffer made us feel better:

> &#8220;To the editor: Ackerman shows knack for being published.&#8221; Hmmm, haven&#8217;t I seen this article before&#8230;say on IvyGate? Well, I&#8217;m sure the reporter credited the idea to IvyGate&#8230;.really, no? Huh. Well at least it&#8217;s newsworthy and timely&#8230;wait, it&#8217;s not? Well at least it avoids a snide comment in the lede about sports&#8230;.well fuck. I give up.

We don&#8217;t blame the freshman reporter so much as the editors, seeing as they&#8217;re the ones who assign stories and then rewrite them in the office. Not cool, guys. Not cool. We&#8217;re like a family, you and us, and _family doesn&#8217;t not give credit when writing about Felicia Nimue Ack_&#8212;[](http://www.observer.com/20061204/20061204_Michael_Calderone_media_offtherecord-2.asp#Beam)
