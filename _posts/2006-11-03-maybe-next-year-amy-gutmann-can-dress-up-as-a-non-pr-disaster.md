Halloween is a fabulous opportunity to make poor decisions. Every year, same story: You start off doing something ironic &#8212; dye your hair, dance to Wham!, get a little too carried away with your Mark Foley costume. Innocent fun. Then you look at the photos the next day and wince at how terrifyingly sincere it all looks.

Well, the unforgiving morning-after eye of Facebook has claimed its latest victim: Penn President Amy Guttman. We&#8217;re sure it felt hilariously tongue-in-cheek to pose with a student dressed as a suicide bomber at her Halloween party. Apparently [these guys](http://www.democracy-project.com/archives/002893.html) didn&#8217;t get the joke. <strike>Li&#8217;l Bo Peep</strike> Gutmann is a front-runner to be the next president of Harvard, and this is hardly the publicity she needs.

P.S. To be fair, &#8220;too soon&#8221; costumes were all the rage this year: at one Ivy party in D.C. last week, two girls showed up dressed as Darfurian refugees, alongside a dude with a bandana and scimitar calling himself a Janjaweed militiaman. They saw us wearing a blazer and asked us to be their U.N. negotiator.

P.P.S. We were scared to write about Saad Saadi &#8217;06, the student in the photo, when we saw his [creepy webpage](http://www.saadsaadi.com/). Then we learned he&#8217;s the one who started [this Facebook group](http://columbia.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2205048199), so how tough can he be? (Saadi posted an apology to anyone who was offended by the costume, says the web site that found the pic; the text is after the jump.)

**UPDATE 8:30 p.m.:** Eric Obenzinger, the _Daily Pennsylvanian_&#8216;s crack opinion page editor, has an interview with Saadi [here](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?page=post&section=2&id=458).

Saadi&#8217;s apology:

My friend, Jason, and I express our condolences and sympathy to all affected by our costumes. We wish to make it clear that we do not support terrorism, violence, or anything that is against society. There is no agenda or statement associated with our behavior shown in these pictures. The costumes are meant to portray scary characters much like many other costumes on Halloween. Additionally, we strive for all societies to instill healthy and non-violent values.
