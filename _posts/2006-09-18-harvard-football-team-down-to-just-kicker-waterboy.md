When head coach Tim Murphy told seniors Danny Lane and James Velissaris in May that they&#8217;d be sitting out the season opener, it was because they [got in a dust-up with a campus shuttle bus driver](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513358). When captain Matt Thomas was canned indefinitely in June, _tout Cambridge_ knew it was over his [ugly blowup](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513872) at his girlfriend. And last week, we hear wide receiver Keegan Toci was [dismissed](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514255) from the team for insulting Coach Murphy at a traditional skit night for the football team. (And obviously, the pileup of discipline cases has the locker room divided &#8212; some team members say privately that this time, Murphy went too far.)

At least the facts are in the open on those incidents. In the biggest case of all, no one &#8212; not even his teammates &#8212; seems to know what prompted Murphy in June to [bench](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514084) starting quarterback Liam O&#8217;Hagan for five games. The starting quarterback! Half the season! One coach reportedly told his players O&#8217;Hagan was fortunate to only miss that much &#8212; leading some to say the QB actually benefited from Thomas&#8217;s assault-and-battery antics, because the team could not handle another high-profile embarrassment.

The off-field drama didn&#8217;t have much effect on the scoreboard Saturday, with the Crimson [thumping Holy Cross 31-14](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514290). But the team&#8217;s backup quarterback blew out his knee, and reigning Ivy champ Brown is up next week. Murphy may be regretting his call on O&#8217;Hagan, or at least feeling some pressure to tell people what in the hell he&#8217;s thinking.
