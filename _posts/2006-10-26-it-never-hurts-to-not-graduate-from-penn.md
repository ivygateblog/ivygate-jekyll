Our ears perked up when we heard one candidate in a New York State Assembly race has accused the other of &#8212; cover your ears, children &#8212; _not graduating from Penn_.

Well, it&#8217;s slightly more complicated. Greg Ball, a Republican running in the 99th district, accused his opponent Ken Harper of falsely claiming he received a B.A. in English from the University of Pennsylvania, the _Journal News_ [reports](http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061025/NEWS01/610250342/1026/NEWS10). Sounds more like Harper fudged it by designating himself &#8220;English, 1978-82, University of Pennsylvania,&#8221; which some political groups misinterpreted and replaced with &#8220;B.A.&#8221;

So Harper attended Penn for four years and didn&#8217;t graduate. Judging from our experience, that&#8217;s actually a huge accomplishment. Once you&#8217;ve been admitted to an Ivy, it takes nothing short of murder to get kicked out &#8212; and [sometimes even that](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/10/19/News/Third.Trial.May.Not.Help.Prosecutors-2376786.shtml?norewrite200610260041&sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com) might not do it. Our advice to Ken: Accuse Ball of graduating!
