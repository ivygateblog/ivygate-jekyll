 <img width="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="453" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/ultimate.jpg" alt="Ultimate Frisbee Gets High. Marks! Gets High Marks!" />Ultimate Frisbee always gets a lot of flak. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sport for stoners&#8221; and &#8220;It&#8217;s a sport for sissies&#8221;; most of the time, it&#8217;s derided as not much of a sport at all. Well, you know what? We&#8217;ve played a game or three of Ultimate, and let us tell you &#8212; these guys are _athletes_. And their pot is _unreal_.

Which is why we&#8217;re delighted by a new study out of the University of Washington that says&nbsp; [competitive Frisbee is a better predictor of academic success](http://www.prweb.com/releases/ultimate/ranking/prweb431459.htm) than grades or even SAT scores. The top seven schools, nationally? Stanford, Brown, Harvard, Tufts, Dartmouth, Yale and Princeton. Falsetto: Hollll-la!

It feels good to find another sport we dominate, after crew and squash. Even the two dozen &#8220;correlation vs. causation&#8221; emails we&#8217;re about to receive can&#8217;t take that away.

We were looking through your site for a good pic, and the best happened to be of this lion-maned Brown kid absolutely destroying one &#8220;Hoffman.&#8221; Take solace in your huger quads.)_
