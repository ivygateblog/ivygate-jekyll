We don&#8217;t want to cover this, but we can&#8217;t ignore it. Welcome to the party, _NYT_; headline says it all.

[The Resume Mocked &#8216;Round the World](http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=8562) [The New York Times]

**UPDATE 3:19 p.m. Oct. 21:** Oh look, Michael J. de la Merced&#8217;s story made it into [the _Times_ print edition](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/business/21bank.html). But with the guts cut out &#8212; what little there were in the first place, anyway. This part makes us want to ram an airplane into an apartment building:

> The Internet scrutiny also raised questions about some of Mr. Vayner&#8217;s claims in his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, including assertions that he ran his own charity and investment firm.
> 
> There have also been questions over whether he copied sections of a self-published book, &#8220;Women&#8217;s Silent Tears: A Unique Gendered Perspective on the Holocaust,&#8221; from Web sites.
> 
> Mr. Vayner, 23, contends that both the charity and investment firm are legitimate. And the accusations about his book, he said, were based on an earlier draft that has since been changed.

Oh! Well then! Mr. Vayner contends, does he? Then everything must be A-okay. You keep doing that tough reporting, Michael J. de la Merced.
