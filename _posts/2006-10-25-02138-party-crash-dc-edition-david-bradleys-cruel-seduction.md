Edition: David Bradley's Cruel Seduction" />After crashing_ 02138_&#8216;s launch parties in [New York](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/inside_the_02138_launch_party.html) and [Boston](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/02138_maddeningly_difficult_to_hate_when_theyre_pouring_free_cocktails_down_your_throat.html), we knew we had to complete the trilogy in Washington. We weren&#8217;t angry at ourselves for giving favorable coverage to the first two &#8212; just disappointed, and you know that always hurts worse. So we went in determined to hate it._ Sigh_. We tried._

When David Bradley, owner of _02138_ and [another rag](http://www.theatlantic.com/a/masthead.mhtml), invites you to party at his home, you don&#8217;t ask questions. A sampling of the questions we didn&#8217;t ask: &#8220;Is Bradley Manor visible from space?&#8221; &#8220;Where did those two Maybachs in your driveway come from?&#8221; &#8220;How would one go about _being_ you?&#8221;

The house &#8212; the former Cuban embassy, we hear &#8212; is a secular materialist&#8217;s conception of heaven: Impressionist paintings. Statuary. Mirrors, everywhere. A chandelier in the kitchen. Wood-paneled bookshelves. Clocks on every other wall. _Couches_ in the kitchen. Ivy spilling out of massive stone-carved furnishings. _A roaring fireplace in the kitchen_.

As we soaked it all in, the magazine brass shushed the room and told everyone the evening&#8217;s guests had collectively clocked 325 years at Harvard &#8212; that&#8217;s, like, 569 in Cornell years! Editor Bom Kim then took a moment to lie with a straight face that this crowd, compared to the New York and Boston launch parties, was way better-looking.

Only two members of [the Harvard 100](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/02138_to_world_were_wealthy.html) showed up: Grover Norquist and Walter Isaacson. We were a little disappointed, considering four of the top five live in DC. (That, and we were totally planning to shave one side of Ben Bernanke&#8217;s face once he&#8217;d passed out). As for the rest of the crowd, thank God for name tags.

On the way out, gift bag in hand (We&#8217;d been meaning to read _The Namesake_! They&#8217;re mind-readers!), we gave in and climbed behind the wheel of one of the two Maybachs. They weren&#8217;t there to be driven; only felt. And as we sat there, petting the hand-stitched upholstery and making quiet _vroom_ noises for a good two minutes, it occurred to us: This is what it feels like to be David Bradley.

We&#8217;re so disappointed.
