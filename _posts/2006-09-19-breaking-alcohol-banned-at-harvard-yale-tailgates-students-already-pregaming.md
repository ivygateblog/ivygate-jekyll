Panicked word has reached our ears that this year&#8217;s Harvard-Yale game will be &#8230; **dry!** Or something nightmarishly close to it!

University officials announced tonight a set of crackdowns intended to avoid a repeat of 2004&#8217;s kick-ass tailgate; among the restrictions are a ban on carrying in liquids of any kind (they know it&#8217;s a tailgate, right, not a transatlantic flight?) and drinking accessories of any kind. But officer, the funnel is for our asthma!

Beer, spiked hot chocolate and possibly wine will be sold for $1 to anyone with two IDs &#8212; and word is that _they will actually be checking them_. Here&#8217;s the rules (thanks, _Crimson_; emphasis ours), each one more fiendish than the last:

  1. Student tailgates will be located in Ohiri Field and will open three hours prior to the start of the game. **All student tailgates will be closed after half-time.** This will be enforced: all students will be encouraged to attend the game. We encourage students to pick up their free tickets at the Athletics Department well in advance of the game date.
  2. For safety reasons, no one will be allowed on top of trucks or other vehicles.
  3. Access to the authorized student tailgate area in Ohiri Field will be limited to individuals with a valid Harvard or Yale ID. (Harvard Alumni may purchase tickets from Harvard Box Office and either Bright or Lavieties in Athletics&#8211;TBA)
  4. All forms of alcohol are prohibited from being brought in to the student tailgating area. **Drinking paraphernalia, items that promote rapid consumption of alcohol, and drinking games are prohibited.** No one entering the student tailgate area will be allowed to bring in any beverages of any kind. No one may leave the student tailgate area with an alcoholic beverage. HUPD will enforce these regulations.
  
    Vehicles entering the tailgate area the night before, and the morning of, the tailgate will be inspected. (All vehicles will have been issued an official pass to enter the area.)
  5. Beer, spiked hot chocolate (and perhaps wine) will be available for purchase by those of legal drinking age. Professional Bartending, Inc. has been contracted to set up four stations (corresponding to our Harvard neighborhoods) where students may purchase drinks for $1.00. There will be fifteen professional bartending staff working at three stations to help avoid lines.
  
    BAT team employees will have stations where students of legal drinking age may obtain bracelets enabling them to purchase alcoholic drinks. Students must show a College I.D. and either a driver&#8217;s license or a passport.
  6. Food and non-alcoholic beverages, including hot chocolate, will be provided free-of-charge for all Harvard and Yale students on a continuous basis during the student tailgating hours.&nbsp;
  7. **Visibly intoxicated individuals will not be admitted** to the student tailgate area. Unruly behavior and **public urination do not meet our community standards** and will not be tolerated in the student tailgate area.
