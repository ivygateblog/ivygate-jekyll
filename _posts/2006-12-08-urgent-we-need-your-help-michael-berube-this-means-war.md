Michael Berube, This Means War" />All right everyone. We don&#8217;t usually ask much of you. But desperate times call for desperate blog posts. See the man/force of nature to the right? This is your enemy. Know his face. For if we don&#8217;t act soon, that face will haunt your dreams and ours night after night, at least through winter break.

He is Michael Berube, our urgently new archnemesis. His blog, [michaelberube.com](http://www.michaelberube.com/), is currently leading IvyGate in the campaign for [Best Educational Blog](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_educational_blog.php) at the 2006 Weblog Awards by 80-odd votes. Clearly this cannot stand.

So here&#8217;s the plan: Vote! Then make all your friends vote! Then vote again! Seriously, make voting part of your daily routine. The rules allow for a new ballot every 24 hours, and we fully expect your sedentary finals lifestyle to whisk us across the finish line in first place, nine days from now.

But as a precaution, our rapid response team is standing by, ready to loose Berube attack ads upon the electorate in the event that his lead surges into the triple digits. As such, Berube-related rumors, allegations and blackmail fodder of the flimsiest kind should be sent immediately to <ivygate@gmail.com>. Oh and did we mention, vote?
