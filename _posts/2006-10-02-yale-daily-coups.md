<img width="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="395" border="1" align="left" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/time.jpg" alt="<i>Yale Daily</i> Coups" />We&#8217;re beyond jazzed about [_The Man Time Forgot_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060505494/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/103-5793063-6827815?ie=UTF8), Y2K _YDN_ editor-in-chief Isaiah Wilner&#8217;s fun-formative romp through Time Inc.&#8217;s heady all-Ivy Twenties days.

The book details how _Time_ co-founder Henry Luce stole all the credit and company shares for the magazine from Skull and Bones brother Briton Hadden &#8230; on Hadden&#8217;s deathbed, no less. It&#8217;s like _This Side of Paradise_ without all the shit subplots and pro-Princeton superfluity! (This, despite David Propson calling _The Man_ a &#8220;first book, and it shows&#8221; in a hilarious [_New York Observer_ review](http://www.observer.com/20061002/20061002_David_Propson_culture_books2.asp).)

This seems as good a time as ever to recap Wilner&#8217;s own shady history with journalistic ethics. Turns out Wilner was forced out of his _YDN_ editorship for his alleged involvement in New Haven voter fraud! According to an [October 1999 _Rumpus_ &#8220;Remedial Media,&#8221;](http://www.yale.edu/rumpus/archives/index.htm) Wilner ran a week&#8217;s worth of puff pieces on his roommate Asit Gosar&#8217;s aldermanic campaign. Then Wilner minimized city section coverage of his roomie&#8217;s election chicanery, which involved Wilner and Gosar telling members of Pierson and Davenport College to vote for Gosar under their residential college addresses (as opposed to their real, off-campus ones in another ward). And Wilner [recused himself from office only _after_ Gosar&#8217;s opponent demanded a recount.](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/y/yale_university/index.html?query=WILNER,%20ISAIAH&field=per&match=exact) For an abridged version, see this [1999 _Yale Alumni Magazine_ short-take](http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/99_11/l_v.html). _Rumpus_ lovingly chronicled other charming encounters with Wilner [here](http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:k2Sr_IipvzYJ:yaledailynews.com/articlefunctions/Printerfriendly.asp%3FAID%3D2683+%22isaiah+wilner%22+rumpus&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3), [here](http://www.yale.edu/rumpus/archives/99-00/feb/html/rumpus_rumpus.html), and, oh, [here](http://www.yale.edu/rumpus/archives/99-00/dec/html/remedial_media.html).
