It gets tiring to hear people talk about the declining beauty standards at your school as &#8220;[name of school] goggles.&#8221; Because _of course_ the first thing you do is to log onto Facebook and compare the Jason Browns and Samantha Millers from your school to the Jason Browns and Samantha Millers of the entire United States. And unless you go to Vanderbilt, with its affirmative action for Latvian models, chances are your school comes out looking pretty homely.

As if we needed any further confirmation, The Hill newspaper has just published the [50 Most Beautiful People](http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/50Most2006/index1.html) on Capitol Hill. How many of these 50 knockouts attended an Ivy? We&#8217;ll give you a hint: it&#8217;s the only outcome more pathetic than zero. That&#8217;s right, one. Meet the [only guy](http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/50Most2006/index5.html) in D.C. with the looks to match the diploma:

Hillary Rodham Clinton&#8217;s (D-N.Y.) reelection campaign</strong>

> 
> Sam Arora, who bears an uncanny resemblance to actor Ben Stiller, was born in New York City and raised in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.
> 
> He graduated cum laude from Columbia University with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in political science. He had intended to major in theater but changed plans after studying politics for a year at Oxford University.
> 
> Arora&#8217;s career in politics began on Capitol Hill as an intern and later as a staff assistant for Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) in 1999. While he was in college, he interned for Hillary2000 and worked in the New York senator&#8217;s D.C. office in 2001 and 2002. He worked in the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s political department in from 2003 to 2004 and has been back in Clinton&#8217;s campaign office since 2005.

Just wait for Capitol Hill&#8217;s 50 Best Personalities. Until then, Sam&#8217;s all we got.
