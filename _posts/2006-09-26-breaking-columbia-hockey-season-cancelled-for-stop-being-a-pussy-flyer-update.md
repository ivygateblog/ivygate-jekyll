Holy crap &#8212; no sooner did we post the below item than we heard the news: Columbia has suspended its club hockey team for the entire fall semester, effective immediately. Its crime: posting a recruiting flyer with the slogan &#8220;Stop being a pussy.&#8221;

&#8220;We recognize that free expression is a vital component of University life,&#8221; said athletics director Dianne Murphy in a statement. &#8220;This disciplinary action is not related to free speech, but rather the abdication of leadership responsibilities by senior members of the Club, and not working within established Club Sports policies and procedures.&#8221;

This strikes us as a pretty epic overreaction; a _Spectator_ sports columnist even found, as we noted below, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/pussytshirtbig.jpg">university-approved t-shirt</a> with the word used less than two years ago. We should probably disclose here a rather large conflict of interest: half of us used to play on the team, so we know its history. Players were caught drinking on game buses two years ago, and, before that, kind of crashed one of the athletic department vans &#8230; into a second athletic department van. But club sports are necessarily rowdy, and if Flyergate is supposed to be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back &#8212; well, then Dianne Murphy has a terrible back.

The full press release is after the jump.

**UPDATE 1:28 a.m.:** A new group has been created to petition the despotic overlords of the Columbia Athletics Department. [The power of Facebook compels you](http://columbia.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2211051753)!

<span class="c1">PRESS RELEASE</span>

The full disciplinary action, determined after consultation with Columbia College administrators and the Club Sports Governing Board, comprised of student members of the Columbia Club Sports Program and Departmental Club Sports administrators (Brian Jines, Dr. Kenneth Torrey), is as follows:

1) The Columbia University Men&#8217;s Ice Hockey Club members in leadership positions are asked to furnish a written public apology to the Columbia University community, recognizing the offensive nature of the recruitment poster. The Club must also acknowledge that it did not seek approval from Club Sports administrators before printing and posting the recruitment flyer.

2) The Columbia University Men&#8217;s Ice Hockey Club is prohibited from participating in the Columbia Club Sports Program during Fall Semester 2006, effective immediately. The Men&#8217;s Ice Hockey Club will not be recognized as an active program of the Columbia University Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and Physical Education until January 16, 2007. As such, the Columbia Men&#8217;s Ice Hockey Club will not receive half of its funding for Fiscal Year 2007 from either the Department or the Student Council. The Club will not have the use of Department-owned vans for transportation, and may not participate in organized practices and competition.

3) The Columbia University Men&#8217;s Ice Hockey Club is hereby placed on two (2) years probation. Any further violations of Columbia Club Sports policies and regulations over the next two academic years may result in the suspension and/or elimination of the Columbia University Men&#8217;s Ice Hockey Club from the Club Sports Program.

&#8220;We recognize that free expression is a vital component of University life,&#8221; says Dr. Murphy. &#8220;This disciplinary action is not related to free speech, but rather the abdication of leadership responsibilities by senior members of the Club, and not working within established Club Sports policies and procedures.&#8221;

No further statement from Dr. Murphy is expected at this time.
