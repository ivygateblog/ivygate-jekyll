Is Charles Nesson the William Shatner of academia? No one&#8217;s really sure why he&#8217;s still around, but we dare not question it. Nesson&#8217;s greatest hits are too many to detail here: Just know that the man they called &#8220;Billion Dollar Charlie&#8221; in _A Civil Action,_ who boasted to students that he always smoked reefer before teaching, who once built a class around the O.J. Simpson case so successful Judge Ito asked his students for legal briefs &#8230; this man may have finally topped himself.

Nesson&#8217;s latest idea is so batshit insane, it just might work. He&#8217;s teaching a class through [Second Life](http://secondlife.com/), the online 3-D social universe in which desperate people interact with other desperate people. (Which means, by definition, most law students already have accounts.) It&#8217;s like The Sims, but with moot court and office hours.

Here&#8217;s the genius promo video for the class. Note (as if they&#8217;re possible to miss) Nesson&#8217;s _CHiPs_-style motorcycle entrance, the absolutely stunning Christopher Walken speech patterns, and the fact that he&#8217;s lopped a _minimum_ 40 years of aging off his digital persona. Daughter Rebecca Nesson makes an appearance as a butterfly &#8212; Jesus, just watch:
