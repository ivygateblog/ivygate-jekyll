Damn it, _that&#8217;s_ how you write a headline! The _Prince_ has a [fine obit](http://dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2006/10/05/news/16071.shtml) up for R.W. &#8220;Johnny&#8221; Apple, the round and well-rounded correspondent for the _New York Times_ who departed us this week after a career that generated [an anecdote or two](http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/030929fa_fact1). Apple did his years at Princeton right: spending so much time at the daily he got kicked out of school. Twice! The _Prince_ has links up to some pieces that we think were well worth the trouble.
