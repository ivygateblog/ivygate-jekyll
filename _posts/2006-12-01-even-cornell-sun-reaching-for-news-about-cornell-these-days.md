> Last night at around 12:30 a.m., a small group of people returned Cornellia, the Dairy Store&#8217;s fiberglass cow, to the pitcher&#8217;s mound at Hoy Field. The group drove a black pickup truck and covered the cow in blue tarp. Largely undamaged, Cornellia wore a wreathe of fake red roses around its neck and a Cornell baseball shirt, while a Rawlings baseball lay at its feet. The cow had been missing since late August and is valued at around $1,500. Cornellia was also stolen &#8212; and returned &#8212; in 2003.
> 
> But the fate of Cornellia&#8217;s calf, also missing, remains a mystery.
> 
> One person involved with the incident vowed that the calf would return &#8212; but not until spring.

All you Cornellespondents out there &#8212; anyone know/care what the hell is going on here? And author Olivia, why grant anonymity to the &#8220;person involved in the incident?&#8221; You know Skorton isn&#8217;t above slapping you with a subpoena.
