<img width="242" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="362" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/election-reese.jpg" alt="Yale College Council Race Off To Irony-Soaked Start" />In the student government universe &#8212; a realm that is equal parts absurd, amusing, and unflinchingly self-serious &#8212; Yale College Council has always served as the Platonic ideal. This year&#8217;s race has already perfected the form.

Sam Heller, Yale &#8217;08 and former editor of campus tabloid _Rumpus_, submitted the following candidacy statement for Pierson residential college council:&nbsp;

> &#8220;What is the YCC?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t really know, but I plan on finding out &#8211; pronto.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll be an exciting adventure for all of us, and we&#8217;ll really grow as people.

> &#8220;With this statement of hope and fabulous dreams, I hereby announce my candidacy for Pierson YCC representative.&nbsp; I hope all of you will get up out of your chairs and put your hands together, &#8217;cause when I say &#8220;Sam&#8221;, you say &#8220;Heller&#8221;! &nbsp;

> &#8220;Sam!

> &#8220;Heller!

> &#8220;Sam!

> &#8220;Heller!

> &#8220;With your help, I can make this the rock &#8216;n rollinest year evar! Hooray!&#8221;

Council rep Steve Engler, &#8217;07, doing a spot-on angry dean impression, responded:

> &#8220;Sam- You know I can&#8217;t accept that. Write a legitimate statement and then I can enter you.&#8221;

The rest of the conversation, in which Heller cc&#8217;ed the _Rumpus_ discussion list,&nbsp;is inappropriate for a family blog. So we included it after the jump. Short story: Heller is back on the ballot. Score one for Dadaist, faux-anti-establishment student council campaigns.

***UPDATE 10:22 p.m.:** See Heller&#8217;s campaign poster <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/images/hellerposter.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.ivygateblog.com/images/hellerposter.html','popup','width=400,height=526,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">here.</a>

I&#8217;d rather be lied to than have Zack Marks try to skullfuck me with his
  
charisma.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank God he got an uncontested race for secretary last year.
