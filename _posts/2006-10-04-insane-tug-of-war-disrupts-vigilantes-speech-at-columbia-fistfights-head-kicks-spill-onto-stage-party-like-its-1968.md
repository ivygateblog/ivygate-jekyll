Cause things at Columbia is off the hook! [Some troublemaker](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/i_tried_to_start_a_campus_controversy_and_all_i_got_was_this_lousy_tshirt.html) invited Jim Gilchrist, founder of the Minuteman border vigilante group, to give a talk at the famously protest-happy school and things _escalated_.

We could make some &#8220;I killed a man with a trident&#8221; jokes, but we just have to let Bwog take over here. Their reporter was [live-blogging the speech](http://bwog.net/index.php?page=post&article_id=2265), which was exciting even before this happened:

> **Update 9:00 pm:** BWOG IS SHOCKED. STUDENTS WITH A BIG YELLOW SIGN JUST CAME ONTO THE STAGE. The sign says, &#8220;There are no illegals.&#8221; Students rise en masse from the audience and rush the stage. The Minuteman and the students engaged in a tug of war with the banner. More people rush the stage, prompting a fist-fight. One female student is kicked in the head. A guy in a pony tail (definitely not a student) rushes the stage and fights with students (several witnesses saw him kick a student) and then banded together with the Minuteman to shout the pledge of allegiance as the rumble spun out of hand, &#8220;One nation! Under God! Indivisible!&#8221;

Seriously, just head over to Bwog.net now. There&#8217;s more &#8212; and more photos &#8212; where that came from, and the [comments section](http://bwog.net/index.php?page=post&article_id=2265#comments) is out of control (<strike>70</strike> <strike>162 417</strike> 508&nbsp;and counting).
