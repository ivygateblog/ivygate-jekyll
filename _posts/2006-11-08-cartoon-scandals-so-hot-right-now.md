But this time the comic isn&#8217;t plagiarized &#8212; it&#8217;s insensitive.

  It started with Nietzsche. Drew Lerman &#8217;10 drew a comic for Monday&#8217;s paper depicting the philosopher coaching a frat boy on how to take advantage of a drunk girl. A few readers concluded that the cartoon advocates rape and proceeded to burn copies of <em>The Dartmouth</em> outside the paper&#8217;s offices. Here&#8217;s Caroline Kerr &#8217;05 in a <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006110702030">Tuesday op-ed</a>:

>   Where does <em>The Dartmouth</em> draw the line? Would a picture of a black student being lynched from Baker Tower make it into the comics? How about a group of students from Hillel being marched off to a gas chamber under a giant swastika?

  A staff editorial in the same edition <a href="http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006110702010">responded</a> that the comic, while racy, &#8220;does not fall under the category of hate speech&#8221; and shouldn&#8217;t be censored. The university&#8217;s Student Assembly issued a strongly-worded statement Tuesday night questioning <em>The Dartmouth</em>&#8216;s journalistic integrity. (Full text after the jump).

  Misunderstood social commentary? Masculist hate crime? We&#8217;re gonna safely go with neither. The joke isn&#8217;t funny enough to be excusable, and the misinterpretation &#8212; that Nietzsche advocates rape&nbsp;&#8212; is&nbsp;too absurd to be offensive. We&#8217;re not sure where this lies on the overreact-o-meter either, but there are two things we never underestimate: 1) a college cartoonist&#8217;s ability to botch a joke, and 2) a campus&#8217;s inability to spot one.
