_In the third installment of [**Blog Man on Campus**](http://www.ivygateblog.com/blog_man_on_campus/), our occasional Ivy bloviation spotlight, our correspondent cries &#8220;Cornell!&#8221; and hears an echo &#8230;_

[Elliott Back&#8217;s Cornell blog](http://cornell.elliottback.com/) is the definitive source for stuff that happens at Cornell. ([When](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/we_knew_there_was_something_we_forgot.html) [stuff](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/yay_a_cornell_item.html) [happens](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/anythinggoes_cornell_week_continues_canstruction_cornell_we_can_and_we_whale.html), that is.) Elliott is an alum with an entire [network](http://elliottback.com/) of blogs to his name &#8212; this one is more concerned with what comes out of Cornell, rather than its daily life. You might not have known, for example, that Cornell researchers have produced a [self-healing robot](http://cornell.elliottback.com/archives/2006/11/19/intelligent-self-healing-robot/). And let&#8217;s give Cornellians their due for advancing a groundbreaking study on why teenagers do stupid things even though, it turns out, they spend [170 more milliseconds](http://cornell.elliottback.com) than adults weighing the pros and cons of whether to, say, have unprotected sex, ride with a drunk driver, or apply to Cornell.

Handy! Oh, and occasionally ugly, twisted and morally depraved. In June there was Elliott&#8217;s [sick fascination](http://cornell.elliottback.com/archives/2006/06/26/ash-thotambilu-alleged-dead/) with a student&#8217;s death; in multiple updates, he wondered aloud whether &#8220;he committed suicide because of academic pressure from his parents &#8230; Without a Cornell degree, there&#8217;s no way he could have gone to medical school and fulfilled their family&#8217;s desires.&#8221; He also parsed the student&#8217;s personal web pages for clues, morbidly highlighting passages like a lit major and asking &#8220;If anyone would like to leave an anonymous tip as to why [redacted] killed himself, send me an email.&#8221; His [breathless coverage](http://cornell.elliottback.com/archives/2005/05/03/pirfo-still-missing/) of another student&#8217;s disappearance in May 2005 betrays the same lack of tact. If [Natalee Holloway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalee_Holloway#Criticism_of_media_coverage) had gone to Cornell, Back may have hyperventilated to death himself.

So. [Cornell Blog](http://cornell.elliottback.com/). Fun tidbits, gruesome rubbernecking. Have at it.
