Your days as Dartmouth&#8217;s athletic director are normally filled with [firing football coaches](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2005010403010), [forcing basketball coaches to resign](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2004021801010), and dealing with the occasional [renegade refrigerated mascot](http://www.playboy.com/on-campus/mascot/keggy/). But now you have a bigger problem to deal with &#8212; Indians!

The North Dakota men&#8217;s hockey team comes to campus in late December for a tournament. What&#8217;s the problem? UND&#8217;s mascot is the Fighing Sioux, a name that the NCAA and some Native American groups protest. Last week, Harper published this [letter to the editor](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006112102030) in _The Dartmouth_, apologizing for inviting North Dakota. (Funny, and we thought [this](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006112101060) was going to be the biggest Native American sensitivity controversy in Tuesday&#8217;s paper.) She says her staff has already met with the Native American Council and that she will soon be divulging a master plan on how her department can better respect Native Americans &#8212; which may include a policy against playing the 14 schools that still use &#8220;Indian&#8221; names or logos.

Does this mean Dartmouth won&#8217;t be playing the Cornell Big Red anymore?
