Spotted at Saturday&#8217;s Yale-Princeton game in New Haven: Barbara Bush &#8217;04, in top form. A <strike>stalker</strike> tipster writes in with exclusive pics:

Maybe we&#8217;re just not familiar with &#8220;tunic dresses,&#8221; but take a closer look at that back pocket technique. Extraordinary! That&#8217;s true Bush-caliber commitment to drinking.
