If you think we&#8217;re making this up, you don&#8217;t know Yale. It&#8217;s a magical land where money grows on elm trees, where residential colleges have funding to burn &#8212; and burn it on glossy 15-month pictorial calendars of nearly naked senior men.

There&#8217;s honestly no explanation for this bizarre document, featuring 15 men from the Class of 2005 (and several of their female classmates) in varying states of undress. Yeah, it&#8217;s an ironic lark &#8212; hopefully &#8212; but we just can&#8217;t get over the production values of the photos, by one Maggie Wittlin. Including the fact that the back cover credits two makeup artists _and a grip_.

Plenty more Branford College beefcake after the jump. _Note: We added text to the above image; the other shots (pics of nearly naked Yale &#8217;05 men, did we mention that?) are exactly as they appear in the calendar. Big thanks to our Yale tipster for the find!_

UPDATE 2:08 p.m.: The YDN [reveals more](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=27835) &#8230;

That&#8217;s Branford master Steven Smith on the real cover, wearing his official cap, a leather blazer and stubble. Way to dignify the college crest, sir.
