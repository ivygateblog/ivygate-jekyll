Wealthy Kids Get P...P...Preference in Admissions?" />From John F. Kennedy Jr. &#8217;83 to Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark &#8217;86, Brown has always attracted high-profile applicants. [Inside Higher Ed](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/09/05/admit) (citing a new book by Wall Street Journal [admissions superreporter](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/PulitzerDG04052004.htm?mod=home_journal_links) Daniel Golden) has the story of how one applicant with a famous last name allegedly got in:

> When then-Hollywood &uuml;bermogul Michael Ovitz&#8217;s son wanted to enroll in 1999 &#8230; Brown admissions officers found the academic record of the younger Ovitz not close to what would be appropriate for an offer of admission. But they were pressured to admit him anyway, with top administrators far more concerned about the abilities of the elder Ovitz &#8211; to host receptions for Brown administrators to raise money, to bring movie stars to campus, and presumably to help build Brown&#8217;s endowment.
> 
> Though Ovitz&#8217;s son was admitted, under special status, he didn&#8217;t last long at Brown and left. Ovitz&#8217;s daughter followed, apparently with more success. And Brown also gained, as the book describes Brown President Ruth Simmons gushing over Ovitz for arranging a campus appearance in which he appeared with Dustin Hoffman, and for hosting a reception for her at Ovitz&#8217;s Brentwood mansion.

There&#8217;s more in Golden&#8217;s book on Harvard&#8217;s use of the &#8220;Z List&#8221; &#8212; a special group of 25 to 50 kids from known wealthy families whose transcripts aren&#8217;t quite up to snuff for normal admittance. They&#8217;re encouraged to apply again in a year &#8212; with the understanding that Mom and Dad will make a big donation in the meantime.

Scandalous! If something you&#8217;ve been 99 percent sure of turning out to be 100 percent certain can be scandalous. Maybe it&#8217;s that the expose is personal this time. We know someone who just got into Brown under suspicious circumstances, and, well &#8230; [we&#8217;re just ashamed of her](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Roberts).
