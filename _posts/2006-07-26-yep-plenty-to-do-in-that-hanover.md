God damn it, now this is what the student dailies ought to be publishing all the time. In what can only be described as a prizeworthy feat of journalism, _Dartmouth_ reporters Dan Duray and Phil Salinger have compiled [the best of the year&#8217;s police blotter](http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2006053101050). It includes such gems as:

> May 21, Massachusetts Row, 1:08 a.m.
  
> Police responded to a reported fight at Thayer Dining Hall. Upon investigation, the police discovered that two male students had been wrestling over a grilled cheese sandwich. Neither party was intoxicated or arrested.

Guess you have to make your own fun up in 03755.
