<img width="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="409" border="1" align="left" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/oldpcad.jpg" alt="<em>Daily Pennsylvanian</em> Makes Great Leap Forward" />The _Daily Pennsylvanian_ is usually ahead of the Ivy newspaper curve, a trend they continue by debuting a couple new Web features for the fall: &#8220;[The Spin](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/?section=2),&#8221; a sandbox for _DP_ columnists; and &#8220;[On the Ground](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/?section=3),&#8221; a rolling man-on-the-street thing, where the street is an email list of students with nothing better to do than sit at a computer and write one-liners about stuff. (We asked to join immediately.)*&nbsp;

They join the sportsblog &#8220;[The Buzz](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?section=1),&#8221; and unfortunately &#8230; they&#8217;re pretty funny. We wish them only ill will and failure. There&#8217;s only room in this town for one irregularly updated, substandard blog, _DP_, and we aim to be that one.

*UPDATE 2:47 p.m.: Deputy Editorial Page Editor Eric Obenzinger writes: &#8220;Sure! &#8230; I think it would be really cool to have you all on the On the Ground roster.&#8221; Oh Eric, you poor, poor fool. You&#8217;ll regret this generosity in no time.
