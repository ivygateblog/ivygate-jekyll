After <strike>slumming it up with</strike> flipping through a back issue of [UVA&#8217;s alumni mag](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/the_difference_between_state_a.html) recently, we noted that it carried a few letters unlikely to appear in the _Yale Alumni Magazine_, an assertion we pulled halfway out of our ass. It got us thinking&#8211;what kind of letters _do_ run in the nation&#8217;s oldest alumni publication? Are they really that different?

>   <span class="break">I am upset to read about the fate of &#8220;Geronimo&#8217;s&#8221; skull</span> in <a href="http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2006_05/notebook.html">Notebook</a> (May/June). Whether or not it belongs to Geronimo, its continued presence demonstrates arrogance and insensitivity on the part of Skull and Bones toward other human beings, especially Native Americans.

>   By keeping this skull and other bones in their possession, Skull and Bones continues to venerate the original act of desecration by Prescott Bush and his friends. In 1983, I was given a short tour of the society. At that time, the skull was locked in a safe along with some other longish bones. There were also two or three smaller skulls on tables in the library, perhaps the plunder of other graves. How would Bonesmen feel today if a fraternity plundered Prescott Bush&#8217;s grave and kept his skull as a trophy for the next 90 years?

>   I suspect Mr. Bush and Mr. Davison never offered the Apache representative, Ned Anderson, what they believed to be Geronimo&#8217;s skull. According to the article, he was shown only the skull of a ten-year-old. The skull that was identified to me in 1983 as Geronimo&#8217;s belonged to an adult. Mr. Anderson, moreover, was never shown any femur bones. It is possible one of the smaller skulls sitting in the library was substituted.

>   The return of &#8220;Geronimo&#8217;s&#8221; skull and the other remains in Skull and Bones to the communities from where they came is long overdue. As the society has the chance to reflect on its past and present actions, I hope it will do so.
