One of the most memorable moments in Columbia football came in 1985, after Jim Garrett&#8217;s first game as head coach. The Lions led Harvard 17-0, but wound up losing in embarrassing fashion, 49-17. In his post-game conference, Garrett went on a tirade and famously called his players [&#8220;drug-addicted losers.&#8221;](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/harvard_university/index.html?query=GARRETT,%20JIM&field=per&match=exact) He was fired after one winless season. Now, 21 years later, another first-year Columbia head coach has followed with an equally unprofessional tirade during a post-game press conference. After the Lions lost to Penn 16-0 on Saturday, a _Spectator_ reporter asked coach Norries Wilson about the team&#8217;s inconsistency on offense. Wilson unleashed his rage for more than six minutes. Listen here, and read Josh Hirsch&#8217;s [dead-on column](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/10/16/Sports/Josh-Hirsch.Coach.Wilson.Crossed.A.Line.With.Remarks-2351684.shtml?norewrite200610181905&sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com) in the DP for a full recap:

[powered by **ODEO**](http://odeo.com/audio/2188471/view){.c1} &#8220;I realize that some of my comments may have been interpreted as critical of Ivy League football game officials,&#8221; Wilson said in a [statement](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/10/18/Sports/Wilson.Apologizes.For.Postgame.Comments-2373933.shtml?norewrite200610190312&sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com) yesterday. Hey Norries, ya think? In case you didn&#8217;t hear the tape&#8230;

> It&#8217;s much harder to play when you&#8217;re playing 11 on 18. I&#8217;m not allowed to comment on officiating, so I won&#8217;t say that we got held. What we should do is hire the Penn O-Line coach to teach our guys how to tackle, because their O-Line does a great job of tackling. And on the touchdown, if you want me to send you the clip, then I&#8217;ll send you the clip where our defensive end was tackled, and nobody made the call.

In the same statement, Columbia A.D. Dianne Murphy said that the school had apologized to the officials, to Penn, and to the other six Ivy League schools. Conspicuously absent from that list: the 19-year-old _Spec_ reporter Wilson blew up at. &#8220;If we handed you a pen, none of you could draw up a coverage or a front, so I&#8217;m tired of hearing about it,&#8221; Wilson says on the tape. &#8220;If you want to come coaching, come coaching if you know so much about football. They work their butts off, so you all can complain about how bad they are. So you can write your negative articles about them every week.&#8221; We certainly have no idea how to draw up a coverage, Nor. But you&#8217;ve scored one touchdown in two Ivy games. So regardless, we feel pretty secure writing that you&#8217;re a jerk.
