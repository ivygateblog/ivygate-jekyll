We&#8217;re not gonna lie. We can&#8217;t stand college television. Nothing short of waterboarding could make us watch another grainy newscast with hovering boom mics and copy lifted directly from that day&#8217;s paper. Thankfully, Columbia Television has found a new method that entertains _and_ complies with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions: soap opera.

The show, titled &#8220;The Gates,&#8221; will track four student characters from the first day of orientation through four years of lust, betrayal, and, we presume, post-colonial theory. First there&#8217;s Julien Tamber, the handsome type A male&#8211;an &#8220;ubermensch&#8221;&#8211;who knows what he wants and knows how to get it. Julien&#8217;s level-headed friend, Terry Marlowe, has to save Julien from getting beaten at a frat brawl in the first episode. Then there&#8217;s the two girls, Sasha and Nare, living in the double next door. Sasha is &#8220;horribly artsy,&#8221; says Davide Barillari, &#8217;09, the show&#8217;s creator. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a soap opera, so she&#8217;s also quite promiscuous.&#8221; Word, ya heard?! But wait, it gets better: Nare is a Korean engineer who starts to suspect she might be a lesbian. That&#8217;s it, we&#8217;re getting the cable package!

The pilot will air around Oct. 20, with a new episode every two weeks or so. They tell us non-Columbia folk will be able to download episodes on iTunes or YouTube, so stay tuned!
