The _Crimson_ has just [posted a story](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515340) on Kathleen Breeden &#8217;09, the Kaavyariffic, Jaysontastic, Glasstacular staffer who has boldly pushed the frontier of plagiarism to cartooning. An Oct. 25 piece bears a &#8220;noticeable similarity&#8221; to an Oct. 12 panel by Pulitzer winner Walt Handelsman in _Newsday_, the _Crimson_ notes.

Exhibit A:

Exhibit B:

Yeah, &#8220;noticeable&#8221; is the word we would have used, too. There are three more ripoffs, the piece says &#8212; but no mention of whether Breeden will be fired. It&#8217;s understandable. Their hands are [pretty full](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/crimson_crisis_pretzelinchiefs_moves_baffle_newsroom.html) right now. (Breeden hasn&#8217;t responded to our request for comment.)
