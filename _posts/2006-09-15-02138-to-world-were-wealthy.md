As IvyGate stands at the port, preparing to wave its kerchief _bon voyage_ to the good ship Bradley, it spies on the dock a mysterious envelope. Could it be? A coveted media kit! We smuggled it home and gave it the old exegesis:

&#8211; The official New York launch party (Sept. 26, crash it with us!) will be at The Core Club on East 55th Street in Manhattan. Repeat, the _Core_ Club. We&#8217;re guessing the Harvard Alumni Association wasn&#8217;t about to let these carpetbaggers sully the Harvard Club for a night, what with their not-quite-Crimson hue and their irreverent section headings. &nbsp;

&#8211; We also found a minor typo in the spelling of a _contributor&#8217;s_ name:

<img width="764" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="184" border="0" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/peretz.jpg" alt="<em>02138</em> To World: We're Wealthy!" />

No big deal, though: this Peretz guy, whoever he is, isn&#8217;t even powerful enough to make the &#8220;Harvard 100&#8221; (see below), let alone get a staffer fired for mistaking his gender.&nbsp;

&#8211; _02138_ claims a circulation of 50,000, and we believe them. Sort of. How they found all these names is a relevant question, considering the Alumni Association&#8217;s mother lion-like protection of its list. &nbsp;

&#8211; The mag&#8217;s big conceit, and the cover of the inaugural issue, is &#8220;The Harvard 100&#8221; &#8212; a running list of the school&#8217;s most influential alums. &#8220;Arbitrary power rankings&#8221; is [our middle name](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/the_ivygate_index_calibrating_hegemony_since_2006_1.html), so naturally we love this, even though it&#8217;s described in the media kit in this baffling way: &#8220;What could make a magazine more readable for, and important to, this audience than one that is truly about them?&#8221; Trust us, it makes even less sense in context.

We&#8217;ll ignore for now the sections named &#8220;Gravitas&#8221; and &#8220;Vanitas&#8221; (&#8220;Harvard&#8217;s Page Six &#8212; with the facts straight.&#8221; Gag) to bring you _02138_&#8216;s first Top 100 list, which has &#8230; um &#8230; 109 names. PR screwup, or brilliant plot to get everyone talking about who will get whittled down? Like we care! Binge away after the jump.

**UPDATE 12:45 p.m.:** _02138_ writes in to tell us that the list of about 100 influential Harvard alumni on the cover is not _the_ list of 100 influential Harvard alumni that will appear in its first cover story. Got that? We asked what the hell the point was, then; &#8220;to give potential advertisers a sense of our community and its diversity,&#8221; a spokesflack said. Thanks, _02138_, for reminding us Natalie Portman went to Harvard.
