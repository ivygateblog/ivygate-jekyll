It&#8217;s hard to hate on Andrew Bujalski, Harvard &#8217;98. Maybe that&#8217;s why film critics, seduced by his effortlessly fawkward dialogue and pasty-face characters, seem to forget all English words except &#8220;generation,&#8221; &#8220;poet,&#8221; &#8220;authentic,&#8221; &#8220;Cassavetes&#8221; and &#8220;zeitgeist,&#8221; which isn&#8217;t even English. The guy&#8217;s new movie, &#8220;Mutual Appreciation,&#8221; got a 100 percent rating on [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mutual_appreciation/). (Meanwhile the brilliant &#8220;The Skulls&#8221; got a [seven](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/skulls/). Sometimes we want to climb up a clocktower.) Come on, people! Where&#8217;s the dissent? Will no one step up and hate Andrew Bujalski?

_F__ine_, if you insist.

**How to Make an Andrew Bujalski Film:** First, choose the six most annoying people you know. One of them should be marginally attractive, if only when backlit. Next, think of the ten most insignificant conflicts imaginable (like a Froot Loop fell on the floor, or you forgot to pick the lint out of the dryer filter). Now outline a series of conversations dealing with those conflicts and shuffle the pages into a random order. Inject your actors with Quaaludes before shooting. Onset, avoid tripods and well-lit areas. If an actor accidentally finishes a sentence or makes a coherent point, yell &#8220;cut!&#8221; and start over. Repeat until famous.

**Disclaimer:** We actually admire Bujalski&#8217;s work. Grudgingly. True story, though: two film buff friends of ours, in a fit of rage after watching his film &#8220;[Funny Ha Ha](http://www.funnyhahafilm.com/),&#8221; microwaved the videocassette.
