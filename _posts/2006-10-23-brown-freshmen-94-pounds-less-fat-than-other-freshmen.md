A new study by researchers at Brown finds that freshmen there [only gain 5.6 or 3.6 pounds](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-10-22-freshman-weight_x.htm?POE=click-refer) (men and women, respectively), less than the storied 15 our RAs gravely warned us about way back when. Brave Eunice Eun &#8217;09 offers herself up to _USA Today_ as a student who did pork up the full amount (&#8220;It was really startling for my parents when I went back home for Thanksgiving break&#8221;), and then burned it off with eight months of vegetables and exercise.

So congrats, Eunice, and congrats, Brown. You make Yale&#8217;s yayo fiends look like the waffle fries line at Six Flags by comparison.
