First, you gotta read our post one minute from now on how [the vast majority of the comments so far have been just awesome](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/commenting_101_lot_of_as_couple_of_b_minuses). Some other stuff, though, we want to get after &#8212; hard. A few blogs (see: [Deadspin](http://www.deadspin.com); [the Bwog](http://bwog.net)) are known for having hilarious and civil comments sections that make the sites much more entertaining than they ever could have been on their own. Others (see: Internet, the entire) are ugly and festering. This site is young enough to go in either direction. We have a choice to make.

Whoever called a girl we posted about a &#8220;total slut&#8221; &#8212; why do you think it&#8217;s cool to be an asshole?&nbsp; Whoever wrote this [tumor](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/medill_journo_all_up_in_ivy_dailies_piece.html#comment-98) &#8212; why do you think it&#8217;s cool to be an asshole? Theoretically &#8212; theoretically! &#8212; Ivygoers are better than that. Look, we&#8217;re the biggest fans around of tearing people and things down &#8230; but do it with a cutting remark, not ugliness.

Uh oh, did we just kill the buzz up in here? No! Er &#8230; ahm &#8230; desperate &#8230; Hey, didja get a load of this [subway breakdancer](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/i_will_see_your_breakdancing_sirs_and_raise_you_a_pole.html) from Penn?
