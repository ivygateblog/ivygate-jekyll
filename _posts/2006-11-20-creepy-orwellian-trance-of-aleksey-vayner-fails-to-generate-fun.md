When Harvard&#8217;s Pforzheimer House announced it was throwing an official [Aleksey Vayner](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/aleksey_vayner/)-themed party last week, we assumed it would be a 495-lb. blast. People could come in karate robes, or Under Armour and dance pants; gently serve tennis balls at 140 miles an hour; there could even be a little table in the back for plagiarizing books about the Holocaust. Picture it: 2 a.m., hundreds of &#8220;Impossible is Nothing&#8221; acolytes swilling Aleksey Ale and Vayner Vodka Tonics, ballroom dancing to the beat of &#8220;Solamente Tu Amor&#8221; and &#8220;The Way of the Sword&#8221; &#8212; what could go wrong?

Alas, as the above photo shows, the event was rather under-attended. In fairness, it _was_ up against Winthrop House&#8217;s &#8220;Country Clubbin&#8217;: A Harvard-Yale [&#8216;Tea Partay&#8217;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTU2He2BIc0).&#8221; More depressing pics after the jump; either this means Alekseygate has officially gotten old (should we cancel our Christmas benefit gala for Youth Empowerment Strategies?), or it&#8217;s just the usual case of Harvard kids unable to have fun when it&#8217;s handed to them on a platter.
