So a Harvard sophomore wasn&#8217;t elected to serve another year on the editorial board of the _Crimson_, and he is just a touch unhappy about it. In a 1,183-word letter of resignation emailed to _Crim_ president Will Marra and the entire board, this kid unloads on pretty much everyone, from the mortals who dared edit his pristine copy to the editors who made the &#8220;baffling&#8221; decision not to keep him aboard.

The entire rant-tastic missive is after the jump. Baby, this is Harvard! You expected to be judged on your merits?

**UPDATE:** After some published [soul-searching](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=519203), we&#8217;ve redacted this kid&#8217;s name.

From: [redacted]
  
Date: Nov 19, 2006 7:52 PM
  
Subject: [Editorial-l] A letter of resignation
  
To: [editorial-l list]

To The Crimson Editorial Board:

I am officially resigning as an editor of The Crimson editorial board.
  
Now before you pigeonhole me as yet another victim of the claws of the
  
&#8220;Turkey Shoot,&#8221; let me tell you that my frustrations are about so much
  
more. The editorial board has proven to be an excluding, cliqued
  
organization that stands commensurate with as final clubs, all while
  
criticizing those same clubs with a hypocrisy that would startle Mark
  
Foley. I loathe the next time the board speaks of meritocracies, because
  
the board is anything but one.

Since I was elected last spring, I have busted my balls for the board,
  
to the point of making sacrifices in my academic work and social life.
  
For some weeks I have even been in the building more than 40 hours. From
  
writing staff editorials during finals week last year to serving as
  
editorial night editor for numerous ungodly news-board-worthy hours this
  
semester, I can righteously say that &#8220;the editorial board has been my life.&#8221;

But during my time on the board, I&#8217;ve found myself often not called on
  
during staff meetings without resorting to rude interruption (while
  
others get \*asked\* if they have an opinion about the issue under
  
discussion or are repeatedly called upon to speak), left out during
  
board dinners and happy hours, and generally excluded from board
  
activities by the fall 2005 comp-class Eliot/Winthrop clique and those
  
currently in the board leadership who have been courted to their favor.
  
I&#8217;m now rarely at any happy hour, because the few happy hours I did go
  
to have only left me feeling further excluded by the status quo. They
  
are anything but &#8220;happy&#8221; for me. And from speaking with other elected
  
editors from my comp class who have become less active with the board,
  
they feel the same way-a general sense of alienation from the
  
&#8220;establishment.&#8221;

Nor has the work I have done for the board been of shoddy quality. Quite
  
the opposite, if you ask any exec which I&#8217;ve worked closely with during
  
layout, they can attest to the fact that I do one of the most meticulous
  
jobs with proofing and laying out the page. These same execs can attest
  
to my strong writing ability as well: With few exceptions, I have always
  
turned in excellent staff editorials and signed pieces which were
  
carefully researched, edited, and fact-checked.

It&#8217;s appalling and disgusting how many times I&#8217;ve been at staff meeting,
  
and no one wants to write the staff editorials that have just been
  
passed (except for the weeks leading into the shoot when everyone wants
  
to demonstrate their &#8220;dedication&#8221;). I see some people chosen for the
  
134th Guard, without naming names, who have not written a single signed
  
piece this entire semester and barely any staff editorials. I see other
  
people chosen as execs who turn in content with quality so atrocious,
  
that each time I&#8217;m in the office doing layout, I hear the current execs
  
profane their work (e.g. &#8220;This staff editorial is so fucking bad&#8221;). What
  
does it mean for our future for people to be chosen as content-editing
  
execs who can&#8217;t turn in one coherent piece that isn&#8217;t riddled with
  
factual errors, syntactical and stylistic gaffes, and logical fallacies,
  
or who haven&#8217;t made any substantive contributions to the board as far as
  
I can see?

(Of course, this doesn&#8217;t apply to all of the associate execs of the
  
134th Guard. Some of you do genuinely deserve your position, even though
  
almost all of you are from the Eliot/Winthrop clique. Nor does this
  
apply to either AMG or DMT.)

And on a more personal note, I ask these same incompetent or undedicated
  
peers, who would be editing and evaluating my signed pieces and my
  
layout work next semester if I do not resign: Who are you to judge the
  
quality of my work, when I was the one often cleaning up after your
  
sloppy content and making so many solid contributions to the board this
  
semester?

Yes, I have &#8220;weaknesses.&#8221; I can imagine being criticized during
  
deliberations for not always being the most fluid elocutionist and for
  
not being able to &#8220;think on my feet.&#8221; No, especially not after running
  
on my feet, dressed up, to the board-wide shoot interview from Cabot to
  
Dunster for 30 minutes in the pouring rain. Or going to a schmooze after
  
getting zero sleep the previous night because I was working in The
  
Crimson (how ironic) and had two midterms that week.

But if I am to be judged on the same terms as a final club &#8220;punch&#8221;
  
would, then God help me. I wasn&#8217;t shooting for President of The Crimson.
  
I wouldn&#8217;t make a good president. Office politics is not my forte. I was
  
shooting for associate editorial executive, a position with
  
solicitation, content-editing, and layout responsibilities. These are
  
things I can do very competently, and I have a demonstrable track record
  
to prove that I am willing to put the time into doing them and doing
  
them well. This record is something that no amount of &#8220;schmoozing&#8221; can
  
erase or build.

Even more baffling is that one outgoing executive even told me at the
  
beginning of the shoot that there would be no set number of executives
  
selected. I quote, &#8220;If we think you deserve to be an associate, you will
  
be.&#8221; Now I ask, what could I have possibly done more, substantively, for
  
the board, short of dropping out of my classes and becoming full-time
  
volunteer staff, to merit a position as a layout and content-editing
  
executive, if I am not even being judged in comparison with my peers?

And so here&#8217;s my question to all the outgoing execs who thought me
  
unworthy: You&#8217;ve hurt me and taken my passion for journalism and The
  
Crimson and stepped on it. Why?

I will be coming in for my last layout assist with DMT after dinner
  
today, a person who is one of the hardest and fairest workers on the
  
board. It&#8217;s truly a pity that I cannot say the same for all the other
  
people chosen as the 134th Guard, some of whom have been chosen more for
  
their social status, personal flair, and &#8220;schmoozing&#8221; (on so many
  
levels) over their dedication to the board and their editing ability.
  
And it&#8217;s truly a pity that the strongest bastion of journalism on campus
  
is driven so much by this kind of farcical inertia.

I&#8217;m sorry for having to write this letter. But as vindictive as this
  
letter has sounded, some things just have to be said the hard way. I may
  
just have driven myself further down a path of social alienation, but it
  
couldn&#8217;t really be much worse than the alienation with which I have been
  
tacitly greeted by some at the board already, far before the shoot
  
process began, right?

Goodbye,
  
[redacted]

P.S. This letter is not addressed categorically to every editor and
  
executive on the board, many of whom I have sincerely enjoyed working
  
with and whom I deeply respect. You all know who you are. Please keep
  
the old sheet flying!
