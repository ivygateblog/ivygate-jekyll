[SexandtheIvy.com](http://www.sexandtheivy.com) offered to cover the mag&#8217;s Boston launch for us, and we had our fingers crossed that she would better resist the open bar and write something scathing &#8212; or at least bed one of the staffers. Alas. Her dispatch:_

When the Head of the Charles Regatta comes around, Harvard locks down.

But _02138_ would hear nothing of that last night. While its alma mater slept in, the new magazine dared to party. Hosted at Via Matta (owner: HBS grad), the Boston launch event saw no celebrity appearances, though alumni did abound. With a slew of Harvard affiliates from almost every school and year, the only demographic that could be pegged down were the &#8220;fallen type-As.&#8221; That is, those who prefer the company of anonymous fellow alumni to interaction with normal human beings.

No sightings of [The Harvard 100](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/02138_to_world_were_wealthy.html), but one guest did purport to be number 101. He also claimed aspirations to his own publication, tentatively named after his mother, Bertha. I&#8217;d get the p.r. people working on that title if I was him.

&#8220;Do they teach awkwardness at Harvard, or do we just come this way?&#8221; I asked my companion after a forced conversation with an alum several generations removed. And here I thought Ivy League social disability was a recent development.

We spent the remainder of the evening downing mysteriously weak drinks and talking to the only other normal people in the room (relatively speaking). We met the acquaintance of pg. 20&#8217;s Republican &#8220;policy doctor&#8221; Lanhee Chen and introduced ourselves to three chicly dressed, refereshingly amiable staffers. Then we found out that two were Princeton-educated, the other a University of Wisconsin grad. That&#8217;s gotta explain it.

When the clock struck 9 p.m., we took a look around. Via Matta was, by now, a few guests short of a crowd. I thought the undergraduate social scene was lacking, but is this what life holds for us as alums?

Perhaps next week&#8217;s launch event in D.C. will be more hopping, but for the rest of the evening, I retreated to a more surefire good time: Happy hour at the _Crimson_.
