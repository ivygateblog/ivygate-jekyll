We flew a little too close to the sun.

We apologize: We handled the 2006 Weblog Awards all wrong. Encouraging you guys to [vote for us](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/12/in_true_ivy_tradition_merit_had_nothing_to_do_with_this_1.html), then asking [again](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/12/urgent_we_need_your_help_michael_berube_this_means_war.html), then undoing another button and leaning forward to ask [yet again](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/12/get_out_the_vote_then_get_it_out_again.html) &#8212; we tainted this blog, a well-tended quad of pristine sarcasm, with the stench of earnestness.

And frankly, we&#8217;re ashamed. It&#8217;s a little like waking up after a bender to realize what you&#8217;ve wrought. (Suffice it to say that we once got up and sleep-peed in our sock drawer at like 8 in the morning, in full view of two stunned friends visiting from high school &#8212; and this post-Bloggies nausea feels even worse.)

To quote a [role model](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196229/): I was wack. Today we leave those posts behind as The Sincerity That Shall Not Be Named, and **[fully endorse Prof. Michael Berube for Best Educational Blog 2006](http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_educational_blog.php)**. He&#8217;s neck-and-neck with [SpunkyHomeSchool](http://www.spunkyhomeschool.blogspot.com/) &#8212; a blog that&#8217;s actually defunct but has rabid acolytes with adept at getting out the vote. Berube seems like a funny guy (and half of us are alums of the same [hockey team](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/breaking_columbia_hockey_season_cancelled_for_stop_being_a_pussy_flyer.html)), but mainly we just want to see the tension play out between&nbsp;the academy&nbsp;and the [homeschooling](http://agenttimonline.com/2006/12/11/get-out-the-vote/) [army](http://www.therebelution.com/blog/2006/12/homeschoolers-unite-vote-for-spunky/).
