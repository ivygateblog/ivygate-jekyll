This year Hashemi packed up and moved out after being [rejected](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/nyregion/06yale.html) by the university&#8217;s degree-granting Eli Whitney Program. But he forgot a thing or two.

Yale&#8217;s Hippo Blog [got its hands](http://www.hippolytic.com/blog/2006/11/remnants_of_a_taliban_dorm_roo_2.php) on a few scraps he left in his off-campus apartment, including an annotated course catalog, some books, and a women&#8217;s lifestyle magazine. Among the things we learn about Hashemi:

  * He dogeared a course called &#8220;Terrorism in America, 1865-2001.&#8221;
  * He subscribed to [Real Simple](http://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/homepage/flash/0,23022,,00.shtml). (Who doesn&#8217;t?)
  * He confessed to not doing the reading in the pages of a Patria Hampl essay collection.

We&#8217;ll leave the psychoanalysis to you fine folks.
