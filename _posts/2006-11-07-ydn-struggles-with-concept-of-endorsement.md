> <span class="ArticleText">The vote of the [Editorial] Board was split evenly as to which candidate to endorse for U.S. Senate. We therefore present the most compelling arguments from each side, and we leave it to the reader to determine their own political priorities and then vote for the candidate who most accurately reflects them.</span>

Bold leadership, guys! May we suggest a plank for the next _YDN_ election in September 2007? _Put an odd number of people on the Ed Board_.
