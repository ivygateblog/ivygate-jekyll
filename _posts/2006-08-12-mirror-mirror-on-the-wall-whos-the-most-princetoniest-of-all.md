Turn your textbooks to page [MyHeritage.com](http://www.myheritage.com), please, the satisfyingest web site we&#8217;ve seen in [weeks](http://www.planetdan.net/pics/misc/georgie.htm). Its nifty facial recognition software eats your photos and tells you what celebrities you most resemble. Sometimes with terrifying accuracy, sometimes not, the results are always amusing. We, for example, are either Colin Farrell and Heath Ledger, or Anne Frank and Dakota Fanning, depending on the software&#8217;s mood.

But that&#8217;s a biased selection, of course. Curious to test the site&#8217;s performance against people we care nothing whatsoever about, we submitted the most recognizable faces of Princeton&#8217;s faculty. The output was &#8230; illuminating. Here&#8217;s a taste, featuring econ professor and _New York Times_ columnist Paul Krugman:

Honestly, they could be cousins. **Point MyHeritage.com!** Three more shots after the jump.

Next, new Fed chairman and former econ department chair [Ben Bernanke](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/dueling_bschool_youtube_part_ii.html):

Okay, so there&#8217;s a glitch in the machine. **MyHeritage.com 1, Reality 1.**

Creative writing professor Joyce Carol Oates, you&#8217;re up:

Sp_oooo_ky! Screw 62 percent, she&#8217;s an absolute dead ringer. **MyHeritage.com 2, Reality 1.**

Finally, let&#8217;s see how the site handles humanities professor Toni Morrison:

Okay, so that&#8217;s kind of impressive. Final score: **MyHeritage.com 3, Reality 1.** This is Anne Frank, signing off.
