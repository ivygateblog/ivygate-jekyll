> Don&#8217;t let this girl&#8217;s costume fool you. She&#8217;s not really a mad scientist. She&#8217;s a girl &#8212; a real, live girl. It&#8217;s just that she has to prove something &#8212; to herself and to her family.
> 
> She has to prove that she has a brain and that, if she ever has to compete with men on their own terms, she can do it &#8212; and win. But she really doesn&#8217;t want to compete with men. In her heart she wants to _attract_ men and eventually, marry one. The girl watcher should not let this situation disturb him, however.
> 
> If the girl is watchable, she should be watched, no mattter what her motives or ambitions may be. The same thing is true of a cigarette. If it&#8217;s smokeable, it should be smoked &#8212; and Pall Mall is the most smokeable of all!

Meet the White-Coated Lab Loon. Meet Pall Mall Famous Cigarettes (slogan: &#8220;Wherever Particular People Congregate&#8221;). Meet the single most sexist ad we&#8217;ve ever seen in our entire lives! It&#8217;s straight from the pages of the _Daily Pennsylvanian_ of Oct. 18, 1962. (A _DP_ columnist [found the relic](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?page=post&section=2&id=359) a month ago, but we missed it til just now.) (We don&#8217;t mean to pick on the _DP_ at all &#8212; this kind of stuff was probably in every Ivy daily.)

Worth noting: a little girl named Amy was 13 when this ad ran, not too many years off from when &#8220;she should be watched, no matter what her motives or ambitions.&#8221; In the 34 years since, we&#8217;d say she&#8217;s done [okay](http://www.upenn.edu/president/gutmann/biography.html).
