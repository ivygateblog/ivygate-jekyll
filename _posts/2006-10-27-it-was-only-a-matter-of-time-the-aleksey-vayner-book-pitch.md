You know, in all the stuff we&#8217;ve written about [Aleksey Vayner](http://www.ivygateblog.com/tags/aleksey_vayner/), we&#8217;ve never actually used the word &#8220;douchebag.&#8221; Well, we&#8217;re getting pretty close to using that term right now. Only we&#8217;re not talking about Aleksey.

Daro Mott and Marcelino Pantoja (Yale &#8217;06, above) sent the book query below to the Wiliam Morris mega-agency. G&#8217;head, read it, we&#8217;ll wait.

> Dear Ms. Suzanne Gluck:
> 
> We would like to preface our query letter with a short paragraph about ourselves. My name is Daro Mott and I graduated from Yale University in May of 2006; I currently live and work in Louisville, Kentucky. My co-author&#8217;s name is Marcelino Pantoja; he lives and works in Tracy, California and he also graduated from Yale this previous spring. We are budding writers and intend to produce a memoir regarding our puzzling friend, Aleksey Vayner, whom we met as undergraduates at Yale.
> 
> In our book, we reveal the most intriguing and entertaining Ivy League persona of today: Aleksey Vayner.
> 
> The story of Aleksey Vayner is both sensational and seemingly apocryphal. On the one hand, Aleksey and his family, penniless, emigrated from Uzbekistan to the United States; at eighteen, he gained admission to Yale University as a tennis recruit. On the other hand, Aleksey Vayner sexed up his accomplishments one time too many: recently, he single handedly became the laughing stock on Wall Street after sending an eleven page r&eacute;sum&eacute; and
  
> promotional video to UBS AG, the world&#8217;s largest asset wealth manager.
> 
> On October 9, 2006, the New York Sun went to press on Aleksey. Within the span of a week, the Wall Street Journal, the Dow Jones News Wire, Fox News, US News and World Report, London Times, Daily Mail, Forbes, the Yale Daily News, Market Watch, the New Yorker and dozens of other national and international media ran articles on Aleksey. The New York Times, the Today Show and other media picked up the story the following week. Following suit, Aleksey Vayner was featured on Inside Edition and MSNBC early this week. Blogs can&#8217;t get enough. Yale students scream Vaynergate. Public interest is skyrocketing!&nbsp; Why?
> 
> Aleksey lifts 495 lbs of steel, clocks a tennis serve at 140mph, whirls around a ballroom dance floor with a gorgeous dancer, shatters six bricks with a karate chop, pulls off fantastic stunts with skis-he choreographs all this information and more in his promotional video. Moreover, Aleksey boasts of being the CEO of Vayner Capital Management, a partner in a mega real-estate development firm, a professional athlete and the founder of Youth Empowerment Strategies (YES), a non-profit. He even claims to have self-published a book on the Holocaust from the perspective of female survivors!&nbsp; Aleksey has chutzpah!
> 
> But Wall Street erupted with laughter. And they have not stopped. Aleksey is being bombarded with requests for interviews. The calls have not stopped. Wall Street circulated Aleksey&#8217;s video and r&eacute;sum&eacute; because, Aleksey, whether we like it or not, is simply entertaining.
> 
> In the light of this, his cadre of friends proposes to write a book about Aleksey situated in Yale University where we first met him. As his closest friends and recent graduates of Yale, we have personal access to him; in other words, we are self-anointed experts of Aleksey.
> 
> In his memoir, we detail the reality that is Aleksey with a flavor made possible from having tasted the &#8220;inside scoop.&#8221; We raise interesting issues and get down to bottom of life at Yale with Aleksey Vayner. We will answer soul searching questions: Who is he? What does he want out of this gift of life? What is folklore, what is reality? Did the allure of Wall Street make a zany guy even zanier? Is he a typical Ivy Leaguer? Is Aleksey Vayner legitimate or is he an imposter? We know the truth.
> 
> We look forward to speaking with you.

> Respectfully Submitted,

The New York _Sun_ as catalyst? &#8220;What is folklore, what is reality?&#8221; Sign us up, you &#8220;budding writers,&#8221; for the &#8220;flavor made possible from having tasted the &#8216;inside scoop'&#8221; on your &#8220;puzzling,&#8221; &#8220;zany&#8221; friend.
