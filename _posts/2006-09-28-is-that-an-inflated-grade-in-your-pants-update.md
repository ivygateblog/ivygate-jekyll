Holy mother of John Harvard are we gorgeous.

Ivy Leaguers are known for their fine-ass brains, but _damn_ if we don&#8217;t have some spankin&#8217; hot crania (not to mention wicked bods) to encase them.

With your help, we searched to the ends of our small, Ivy-strewn universe to find the most exquisite professorial specimens in the Group of Eight. We then narrowed down the nominations to the truly stunning. These men and women, whose oratorical flourishes are matched only by their sex-me-now stares, are the hottest thing to happen to the League since co-ed dorms.

So peruse the menu below, choose the objects of your desire, and check back soon to see what _real_ college rankings look like.

    <strong>UPDATE 5:09 p.m.:</strong> We have received <a href="http://www.diverseeducation.com/artman/publish/article_5884.shtml">disturbing news</a> that Faculty Stud finalist Robin Kelley is no longer a professor at Columbia, having fled for USC in May, presumably to repair the university&#8217;s hottie quotient after the departure of Matt Leinart. Kelley is <strong>immediately disqualified</strong> from the contest; should the final tally be close, we&#8217;ll redistribute his votes in some insane way. IvyGate regrets the error.
