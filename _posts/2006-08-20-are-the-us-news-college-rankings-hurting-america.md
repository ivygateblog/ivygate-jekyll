In response to the big, corporate McRankings establishment, the magazine&#8217;s August issue offers its own [list](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0609.national.html). Instead of ranking colleges by alumni giving or selectivity or &#8220;peer assessment&#8221; (this criterion reeks of smoky back dean&#8217;s offices), they base their assessments on **community service**, **research**, and **social mobility**. Of course this knocks Harvard down to No. 28 and Princeton to No. 43 &#8212; a cigarette butt in the eye of East Coast elitism.

Because every time a Big Ten school breaks into the Top 10, a Shiite milita disbands.
