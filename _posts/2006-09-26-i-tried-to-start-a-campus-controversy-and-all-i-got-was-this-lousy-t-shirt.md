Columbia is abuzz &#8212; or trying to be &#8212; over two controversies right now. One involves right-wing allegations of a [slush fund subsidizing elite Manhattanites&#8217; abortions](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/09/20/Opinion/Parental.Consent.And.Columbia-2286296.shtml?norewrite200609261150&sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com). The other is about &#8230; a club sports flyer. The contest is closer than you might think. Observe:

Junior Chris Kulawik, the school&#8217;s resident conservative, penned a column last week pointing out that if Columbia will privately cover abortion costs up to $500, and students pay only $350 in Health Services fees, the remaining $150 must be coming from &#8220;somewhere else.&#8221; Ominous! Just the kind of abortion hors d&#8217;oeuvres the _New York Sun_ would love to sink its teeth into. But Kulawik is up against &#8230;

**&#8220;Stop being a pussy.&#8221;** That&#8217;s the line on an orientation week flyer that landed the club hockey team in surprisingly hot water, with all four student council presidents co-signing an outraged letter to university administrators. That&#8217;s two more presidents than signed a letter protesting the [scheduled lecture](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/we_still_cant_believe_harvard_let_that_khatami_guy--what_the.html) from Holocaust-denying, Israel-off-map-wiping Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, [one student noted](http://media.www.columbiaspectator.com/media/storage/paper865/news/2006/09/26/Sports/Overboard.With.The.Political.Correctness-2308028.shtml?sourcedomain=www.columbiaspectator.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com). (He also found the university-approved 2004 t-shirt at right. (Disclosure: We know the guy.))

Which wannabe furor will prevail?&nbsp;We&#8217;ll bring the nachos, you bring the&nbsp;Columbia student&#8217;s&nbsp;uniquely insatiable appetite for protests.
