> &#8220;Today, making my way through Harvard Yard, who should I see but Lou Dobbs standing over a pile of fetid and discarded dorm-carpets, apparently being offered for resale to the parents of new freshmen, just arriving. &nbsp;He looked puffy, greasy, and lumpy all at once.
> 
> &#8220;Several hours later, making my way back home, I ran upon Lou Dobbs again. By this point he had purchased, and was wearing, a terrible Harvard hat. He was lighting a cigarette as if it might be his last. &nbsp;Does the man have a child starting school up here, or was he just creeping folks out on assignment?&#8221;

Outstanding. We&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to encourage all readers to hone their stalking skills by [notifying us](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com) posthaste of any celebs &#8212; and we use the term loosely &#8212; appearing on campus. Especially those that look &#8220;puffy, greasy, and lumpy all at once.&#8221; Grade inflation awarded for cameraphone pics.
