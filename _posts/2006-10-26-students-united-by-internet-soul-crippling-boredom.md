<img width="325" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="322" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/asleep.jpg" alt="Students United by Internet, Soul-Crippling Boredom" />If students had a rallying cry today, it would probably be &#8220;We&#8217;re bored as hell and we&#8217;re not gonna take it anymore!&#8221; And where&nbsp;are the&nbsp;legions of bored people congregating? Online, naturally.

The anonymous chat site&nbsp;[Bored at Butler](http://www.boredatbutler.com/)&nbsp;&#8212; a&nbsp;reference to Columbia&#8217;s Butler Library &#8212; launched last fall and quickly became Columbia&#8217;s id. Students don&#8217;t vent; they fume. The discussion doesn&#8217;t devolve; it starts on the ground level. No subject is off limits, from racial stereotypes to sex positions to whether the girl in the green sweater in Room 209 is a virgin. You&#8217;ll also find <strike>the occasional</strike> nonstop solicitation. This conversation excerpt is pretty representative:

> &#8220;sex now?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I&#8217;d be game&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;but alas&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;where is everyone else&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;we&#8217;re all guys&#8221;

Now the site&#8217;s creator, Jonathan Pappas &#8217;06, has used the B@B template to create [Bored at Lamont](http://www.boredatlamont.com/) for restless Harvard kids and [Bored at Bobst](http://www.boredatbobst.com/) for NYU. Pappas thinks the Columbia site&#8217;s popularity was &#8220;difficult to recreate elsewhere&#8221; since it&#8217;s the result of a &#8220;culture specific to Columbia.&#8221; But wait, what&#8217;s more universal than sounding off online behind a comfy veil of anonymity?

&#8220;The goal of these Web sites was to create a forum for truly free speech,&#8221; he wrote in an e-mail.&nbsp;&#8220;Taking away inhibitions results in a colorful display of extreme brilliance and extreme ignorance.&#8221;&nbsp;Take it away, comments section.
