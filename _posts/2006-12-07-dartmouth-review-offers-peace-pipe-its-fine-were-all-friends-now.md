The editors of the _Dartmouth Review_ posted letters today apologizing for their [recent cover](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/dartmouth_review_delicately_enters_native_american_debate.html) depicting a scalp-wielding Native American. Well, &#8220;apologize&#8221; might be too generous. They regret that people were offended.

In [one letter](http://www.dartreview.com/archives/2006/12/02/the_cover_story.php), Editor-in-Chief Daniel Linsalata &#8217;07 says the cover was meant to be &#8220;hyperbolic, tongue-in-cheek commentary&#8221; directed at the Dartmouth Native American community&#8217;s leadership, not the community itself. The managing and associate editors separately [call](http://www.dartreview.com/archives/2006/12/06/the_cover_was_a_mistake.php) the cover a &#8220;mistake,&#8221; and regret that it distracted from the publication&#8217;s &#8220;serious journalism.&#8221;

As terrible as it sounds, these guys learned a lesson. [Cue &#8220;Full House&#8221; lesson-learning music.] There&#8217;s many a broken soul on the shoulder of the student publication highway &#8212; people who think irony is a defense for the patently offensive. But these guys seem to have emerged relatively unscathed. They stand by their content. They still work for the paper. Their Cato internships remain secure. Peace reigns throughout the land.

Offering a peace treaty to the Native Americans, huh? Yeah, that has a sterling history of working out well for them.
