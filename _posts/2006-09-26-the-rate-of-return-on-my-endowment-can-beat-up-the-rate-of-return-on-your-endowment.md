Only this time, it&#8217;s the _derivative_ of that arc of piss! Inside Higher Ed reports:

> Yale University may be #2 in endowment size, but it topped #1 Harvard in rate of growth, according to data released Monday. <a href="http://www.yale.edu/opa/newsr/06-09-25-04.all.html" target="_blank">Yale reported</a> a 22.9 percent return on its endowment in the fiscal year that ended June 30, bringing the endowment to $18 billion. <a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/09.21/99-endowment.html" target="_blank">Harvard</a> last week reported a 16.7 percent return, allowing its endowment to exceed $29 billion.

Only 16.7 percent? Incompetence! Who&#8217;s in charge of the Harvard endowment these days, Tara Reid?
