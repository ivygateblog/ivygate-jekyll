Here&#8217;s a specimen from our most recent foray. When the news hit that Toad&#8217;s, Yale&#8217;s guilty-pleasure dive bar, was [opening up new branches](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=33284) in Richmond and Trenton, one student reacted the only way she knew how: in verse._

Two Toad&#8217;s emerged in two college &#8216;hoods.
  
We&#8217;re sorry: we can&#8217;t get crunk in both.
  
Faux-townie teetotalers, once straight-A good
  
We signed affidavits as best we could
  
&#8216;Neath New Haven po-po and elm undergrowth.

New [Toad&#8217;s Richmond](http://www.shockoeslip.com/), not half as fair,
  
Is hardly less cliched and lame
  
Because it has less wear and tear.
  
Though as for passing Saturdays there,
  
Could whoring _sans_ [Yorkside](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=yorkside+pizza+new+haven&sll=41.306633,-72.933168&sspn=0.030948,0.057678&ie=UTF8&latlng=41308056,-72928611,17326991000790261857) taint us the same?

For both will have vodka breath post-lay,
  
Tube tops tight as snatch pre-[Q-Pac](http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=3756) &#8230;
  
Oh, we saved that story for our best Yale gay!
  
Yet knowing Toad&#8217;s is better on Wednesday,
  
Trenton&#8217;s weekends won&#8217;t bring sexy (house remix) back.

We shall one day tell this with a sigh
  
Somewhere at federal elections hence:
  
Two Toad&#8217;s diverged twain Mason and Dixon&#8230; Aye,
  
We claim the one first shitfaced by,
  
And that has made all the difference.
