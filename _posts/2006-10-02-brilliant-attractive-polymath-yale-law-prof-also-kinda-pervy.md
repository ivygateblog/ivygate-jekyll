<img width="150" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="200" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/rubenfeld-jed.jpg" alt="Brilliant, Attractive, Polymath Yale Law Prof Also Kinda Pervy" />There&#8217;s nothing we love more than professorial flirtations with pop culture, be they as straight-faced as Margo Jefferson&#8217;s [_On Michael Jackson_](http://www.amazon.com/Michael-Jackson-Margo-Jefferson/dp/0375423265/sr=1-1/qid=1159765575/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-5407664-2408042?ie=UTF8&s=books) or as laughable as Cornel West&#8217;s [LP](http://www.amazon.com/Sketches-Culture-Dr-Cornel-West/dp/B00005OC67/sr=1-1/qid=1159765631/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-5407664-2408042?ie=UTF8&s=music). Now comes Jed Rubenfeld: Yale law prof, Freud enthusiast, and, we hear, the next [next Dan Brown](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/draft.html).

His new book, _The Interpretation of Murder_, has the makings of a hit. Historical backdrop (turn-of-the-century New York), controversial figures (Freud, Jung), and some of the freakiest sex scenes to drip from an Ivy Leaguer&#8217;s pen since that [adjunct got desperate for cash](http://www.amazon.com/Callgirl-Confessions-League-Lady-Pleasure/dp/0060736054). Here&#8217;s a [quickie](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/books/review/Calhoun2.t.html?ex=1159934400&en=6ef51b28e39814f2&ei=5070) from the _NYT Book Review_:

> &#8220;[T]here&#8217;s a hot girl strung up from the ceiling, being suffocated with a silk tie and cut with a razor while she&#8217;s coached by her abuser to moan in pleasure. Her torture is shamelessly eroticized: &#8216;She cried out, her back curved in exactly the same arch as the great windows, her raven hair flowing down her back &#8230;&#8217; &#8220;

Later:

> &#8220;&#8216;From above, Nora watched him light a cigarette in the flame of her bedside candle, place a knee against her supine form, and extinguish the glowing cigarette directly on her skin, down there, only an inch or two from her most private part.'&#8221;

Yowza! All that privacy law making you antsy, Jed? If [this slobbering review](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/books/31masl.html?ex=1159934400&en=d75b9cea86e1fe60&ei=5070) is any indication, Rubenfeld can soon trade his crappy day job for the glamorous life of a Hollywood screenwriter. (Or at least the kind whose stuff airs at 10 p.m. on channel 512.)
