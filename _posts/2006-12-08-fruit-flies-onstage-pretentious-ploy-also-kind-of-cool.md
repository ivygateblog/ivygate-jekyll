Joining the club today is a Brown staging of Sartre&#8217;s _The Flies_ &#8212; a wartime allegory already deeply infected with the p-word. We&#8217;re always suckers for a good gimmick, so imagine our pleasure when we heard they&#8217;ll be [releasing 30,000 fruitflies during the performance](http://www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/12/06/ArtsCulture/Pw.Show.To.Unleash.30000.Fruit.Flies.On.Stage-2524703.shtml?norewrite200612080052&sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com&sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com%25253E).

Sorry, but this is _awesome_. To keep the flies from escaping, they&#8217;ll not only be enclosing the seven-by-seven-foot stage in netting &#8212; they&#8217;ll be _putting the audience inside, too_. Apparently they had a biochem concentrator breed the flies especially for the play. Can you seriously make that many? How has a disgruntled science major not unleashed like a jillion drosophilae melanogaster _[Ed.: Vocab, motherfuckers]_ in the cafeteria as a prank yet?
