Brown University was actually number _[six](http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1ccbach_s_brief.php)_ in the _U.S. News_ liberal arts rankings! It also charges $16,000 for tuition, has a firm grounding in the Protestant faith, and is located in Arkansas!

Oh shit. Sorry, that&#8217;s [_John_ Brown University](http://www.jbu.edu/). We almost thought our friends in Providence had shattered a stereotype &#8212; how disappointing.

What&#8217;s _really_ disappointing, though, is that JBU&#8217;s namesake isn&#8217;t even crazy-eyes-abolitionist-martyr-who- hacked-his-victims-to-death-with-a-broadsword [John Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_%28abolitionist%29). It&#8217;s named after John E. Brown, a kind evangelist who taught needy children after WWI. Couldn&#8217;t they just fudge it, though? It&#8217;s a Christian school, after all, and Brown the Crazier did think he was the Avenging Angel of Death.

But hey, at least it&#8217;s [diverse](http://www.jbu.edu/news/facts.asp), right? No? Better fix that, or J-Bro might have to chop up a bitch.
