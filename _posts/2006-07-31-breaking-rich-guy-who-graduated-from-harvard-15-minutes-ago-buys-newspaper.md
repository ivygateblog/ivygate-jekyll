Because they [buy entire newspapers](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/business/media/31observer.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin) at 25 with trust fund money, the sick, too-handsome, pluto-chieving pricks!

Sorry, that&#8217;s not being entirely fair to Jared Kushner, Harvard &#8217;03, new majority owner of the _New York Observer_. According to the _Times_,

> &#8220;Mr. Kushner said that the money he was investing was his own, earned while he was an undergraduate at [Harvard](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/harvard_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org "More articles about Harvard University."). **In between cramming for finals**, he bought and sold nine residential buildings in Cambridge, Mass., with backing from a number of investors, including family members.&#8221;

Emphasis ours, clearly. _During finals?_ Holy shit, the best thing we ever did during exam week was beat Super Mario World on a sweet emulator for the Mac. Getting really good on Text Twist is probably runner-up. _[Ed.: Actually, half of us got a BJ in the stacks the night after finally turning in the last term paper of the semester, which was totally aweso&#8211;FUCK! We don&#8217;t own a Manhattan newspaper!]_

Sorry, back to our seething Kushner jealousy. We wish you the best, pal. The _Observer_ is a terrific rag, and [you seem to know what you don&#8217;t know](http://gawker.com/news/top/i-own-you-and-i-can-legally-rent-a-car-190866.php). Keep an eye out for our resume come hiring time, you precocious publishing-magnate-in-diapers handjob, you.
