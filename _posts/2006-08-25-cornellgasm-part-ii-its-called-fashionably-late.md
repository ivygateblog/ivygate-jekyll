<img width="177" hspace="10" height="175" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/belated-birthday2.jpg" alt="Cornellgasm Part II: It's Called &quot;Fashionably Late&quot;" />Our apologies for missing your first day of classes, Cornell &#8212; all-day hangovers are like that. Actually, it was your bizarrely early start date that threw us. August 24? Orientation was on the _18th_? When are your finals, Halloween?

Look, we know you&#8217;re [new to the party](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/do_you_know_who_youre_dealing.html), founded after the Civil War and all. We like you &#8212; go Big Red hockey! &#8212; and we&#8217;re here to help! Take a cue from big bros Harvard (starts Sept. 18) and Dartmouth (Sept. 20th, fucking A). That&#8217;s entitlement itself, rolling into the fall semester whenever they goddamn please. Good Lord, classes in Ithaca begin before the University of Richmond. Outrageous! Skorton, add it to the [to-do list](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/cornellgasm_president_skortons_first_day.html).
