Only a freshman, he&#8217;s [penned a piece](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=33912) about Aleksey Vayner with actual (gasp) reporting! Unlike the [toothless](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/21/business/21bank.html) _Times_, [credulous](http://www.gawker.com/news/clips/douchebag-getting-a-lot-of-wear-out-of-that-one-suit-209547.php) MSNBC, or [effortlessly spun](http://www.gawker.com/news/aleksey-vayner/douchebag-hires-attorney-cries-and-moans-208752.php) _New York Post_, Kaplan&#8217;s piece moves the ball, noting that the president of Charity Navigator has asked <span class="ArticleText">New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to investigate Vayner&#8217;s fake charity.</span>

<span class="ArticleText">Also &#8212; and this is pure sugarcane &#8212; <strong>it&#8217;s apparently Academic Integrity Awareness Week at Yale now</strong>, but deans are stonewalling on whether they&#8217;re looking into Vayner&#8217;s several plagiarisms.</span>

<span class="ArticleText">Kaplan&#8217;s piece is a serious take, but the last two sentences are the funniest thing we&#8217;ve read all week:</span>

> <span class="ArticleText">Vayner&#8217;s attempt to stand out in his application appears to have backfired, although advertising executive Donny Deutsch said on MSNBC he would hire Vayner immediately for his creative genius. Director of Undergraduate Career Services Philip Jones declined to comment on whether Vayner&#8217;s strategy is a sound one.</span>

> But with Halloween less than a week away, some Yalies in need of an outfit may have found inspiration of their own in the Vayner scandal: some students said that &#8220;Aleksey Vayner&#8221; will likely be a popular costume on campus this year.

One Metro North ticket to New Haven for Oct. 31, please! If we come out there, will someone throw a party?
