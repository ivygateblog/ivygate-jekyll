At least the people calling for [this guy&#8217;s](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/but_what_have_you_won_for_me_lately.html) resignation have a coach with a passing interest in winning games and retaining his players. Saturday&#8217;s battle of wits between Columbia&#8217;s football coach Norries Wilson and Harvard&#8217;s Tim Murphy left us wondering if this Toothpaste Sandwich Crazy Bowl had a corporate sponsor.

Harvard&#8217;s Tim Murphy had homefield and did his best to squander this mental chess match, but ultimately failed in his [attempt](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/varsity_blues_showdown_erupts_at_harvard.html) to alienate his entire roster. Liam O&#8217;Hagan, the quarterback Murphy benched sans explanation for the first, oh, five games, played just fine in his personal home opener, completing 16 of 26 passes for 181 yards and one touchdown. Senior wide receiver Keegan Toci, of course, did not play, due to being kicked off the team for his <strike>explusion</strike> <strike>drunk driving</strike> <strike>assault charge</strike> [opinions](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/harvard_football_team_down_to_just_kicker_waterboy.html).

But Murphy was no match for Wilson, who will see Murphy his [roster alienation ante](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/you_want_the_truth_columbia_football_coach_cant_handle_the_truth.html) and raise him by also despising points and yards. The Lions mounted a rushing attack of negative 14 yards on the afternoon, prompting Wilson to really come down hard on his offensive unit: &#8220;I thought our offense probably played the best game they played all year,&#8221; Wilson told the [Spec](http://www.columbiaspectator.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=7bbd3fd5-e263-4311-aa38-a4dec9192edc). &#8220;I know they turned the ball over four times, but I think they&#8217;re coming along.&#8221;

Coming along indeed, especially when your philosophy is don&#8217;t score. In the fourth quarter, Lions&#8217; place kicker Jon Rocholl booted a 40-yard field goal, but a personal foul on Harvard gave Wilson a narrow window of opportunity to take the points away from his team. Wilson seized on it and declined the made field goal, and the Lions were able to capitalize on this opportunity to not score. All it took was an illegal block and a missed field goal on the second attempt, and Wilson&#8217;s 24-7 defeat at the hands of comparative genius Murphy was complete.

Note: Harvard&#8217;s running back Clifton Dawson (120 yards, 2 TD) came up just 57 yards shy of breaking Ed Marinaro of Cornell&#8217;s all-time Ivy rushing record, and is poised to break it this Saturday at Penn. This will be one less reason to cover Cornell.
