We&#8217;d like to sloppily thank the RT crew (You know who you are! So cute how you don&#8217;t want your names associated with this!) for filing it each day at the crack of lunch; you were funny, comprehensive, and became informed about the Ivy League, and for that we apologize.

Given even a taste of freedom, we assume several if not all of them will flee for the gorges. Interested in taking up the yoke and becoming a RagTime correspondent next semester? [Email us](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com), preferably in bullet points, with an inappropriate headline.
