There is officially nothing new to report on Aleksey but we bring you this anyway, because it delights us. Some Italian newspaper called _Corriere Della Sera_ is [on the case](http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/10_Ottobre/12/yale.shtml), and thanks to [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corriere.it%2FPrimo_Piano%2FCronache%2F2006%2F10_Ottobre%2F12%2Fyale.shtml&langpair=it%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools), we can say with authority that no better summary of the situation has ever been written. Guilt of the crisis, indeed.

And this although turns out to you drained to us absolutely extraordinary. Its candidacy has been rejected from the main merchant banks &#8211; Ubs, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse Group and Jp Morgan Chase &#8211; one after the other. Guilt of the crisis? More probably the guilt is of the stramapalato chosen way from the young person in order to introduce to the possible futures employers. Vayner has realized in fact amatoriale filmato of approximately six minuteren (? Guarda the video), and it sendes it to the companies like autopromozionale message, with to the curriculum.

In foundation the voice of the aspirant banker who tells the own qualities, says to have consideration for the mediocre ones and does not explain as &#8220;its impeccable physicist reflects its mental acumen&#8221;. A video judged too much audacious and adulterated from the employers that have not saved to the boy little lusinghieri comments and derisioni, beyond to sbattergli the door in face. For all answer, the full of rocks Vayner has threatened to make cause for violation of the privacy the field revives human of Ubs, to which it had sent just the curriculum. The megaphone of the company, Kris Kagel, has made to know that Ubs is adhered rigidly to the laws for the treatment of the data of the numerous candidates. &#8220;If some violation were found, they would be taken however the just provisions&#8221; have concluded Kagel. But while the video of Vayner is ended in Net. With good peace of the privacy.
