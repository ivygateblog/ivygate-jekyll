Being one of the 34 people injured Tuesday afternoon when a Fung Wah driver took on an exit ramp at top speed, [capsizing the thrifty vessel](http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=156099) and sending it careering onto the grassy shoulder.

No word yet if any Harvards were on the bus or injured, but the accident might give some pause to the hundreds of <strike>cheapskate</strike> financially responsible Crimson students who use the DC-New York-Boston service regularly, especially in the week leading up to classes. State and federal transportation agencies say they&#8217;re going to [investigate Fung Wah&#8217;s safety record](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/09/07/fung_wah_bus_line_faces_state_federal_scrutiny/?p1=email_to_a_friend), but even if they shut the line down, there&#8217;s something like a dozen more to take up the slack. Maybe that fat guy sitting next to you is useful after all, as a pudgy airbag.
