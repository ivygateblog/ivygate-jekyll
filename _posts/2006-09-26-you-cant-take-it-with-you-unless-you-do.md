One minute you&#8217;re a senior &#8212; respected, feared, laid. Then: poof, you&#8217;re getting chewed out by a boss who doesn&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass how many debate teams you captained or&nbsp;kegstand records you hold. Leaving college means you have to give it all up.

Unless, that is, you&#8217;re Burt Helm, Yale &#8217;04.

We poured one out when <span class="st">Helm</span> graduated, thinking we&#8217;d seen the last of his spectacular _YDN_ column &#8220;Effin Sweet,&#8221; which was mostly about him failing to impress girls. Fast forward to now, when we saw his byline in a recent issue of _BusinessWeek_. The guy hasn&#8217;t changed one bit! We&#8217;ve jumbled up some passages and headlines from &#8220;Effin Sweet&#8221; and&nbsp;_BusinessWeek_ (print edition and web). See if you can tell which is which:

> 1. When I&#8217;m in the soap aisle, like a lot of other guys, I&#8217;m running an equation in my head: Which brand will do the best job cleaning me, while not sounding completely girly? Soaps with names like Aveeno Positively Radiant, St. Ives Oatmeal & Shea Butter, or Pure Cashmere are unquestionably out of the running.
> 
> 2. &#8220;One More Reason to Hate Preppy White Rappers &#8212; and Smirnoff&#8221;
> 
> 3. <span class="ArticleText">The people at KFC get pretty confused and unfriendly when you bring up the idea that you want to &#8220;exchange&#8221; 20 pieces of chicken. I actually had to negotiate a deal with them where they would make 16 pieces of extra crispy, but keep 4 of the regular.</span>

> 5.&nbsp; &#8220;I _am_ gay! Look at my jeans! Would a straight guy ever wear these jeans? They&#8217;re ridiculous!&#8221; There is a point a guy reaches when the prospect of hooking-up seems so close, so tangible, he will do anything.&nbsp;

Cheers, Burt. May the wind always be at your back.
