We know a true Ivy overachiever would play it cool. Used to success &#8212; or pretending to be &#8212; she&#8217;d act like it was no big deal.

But as our server smokes a postcoital cigarette after being gang-banged by [Gawker](http://www.gawker.com/news/media/industry-shocker-half-of-the-mostly-white-men-in-top-media-slots-went-to-crappy-schools-like-uva-197297.php), [WSJ](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/08/28/but-does-gilberts-make-an-outline-for-this/), [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2006/08/29/the-media-is-one-big-ivy-_e_28207.html), [American Prospect](http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2006/08/post_1276.html), [Jossip](http://www.jossip.com/gossip/lindsay-lohan/jiblets-we-bet-lindsay-lohans-vag-is-beautiful-like-a-flower-20060829.php) and a few others in the last 36 hours, we gotta break character and say thanks for the nods, guys. One month in, this blog has already become something we didn&#8217;t expect: fun. And to our 26,000 new readers: bookmark the shit out of us, &#8217;cause the fall semester is about to get wild around here real fast.
