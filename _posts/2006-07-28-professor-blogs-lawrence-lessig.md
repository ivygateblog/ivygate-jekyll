One of the worst things a non-tenured professor can do is start a blog. At best, he will earn the bemused pity of his students. At worst, it will [ruin his career](http://www.juancole.com/).

But every thousand years or so, along comes a professor with just the right combination of attitude, intellectual prowess, and raw sexual energy to pull it off. That&#8217;s right: [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/blog/), B.A, B.S., M.A., J.-mother-fucking-D. Just try talking shit about his blog&#8211;he will hear it from all the way over in Palo Alto, pause his pool game for as long as it takes him to kill you with his mind, and then sink the eight ball corner pocket shot he&#8217;d been lining up when you made that fatal decision to mess with the Less. And if you were about to bring up something about Stanford not being an Ivy, don&#8217;t even go there. The man&#8217;s CV is longer than your double-spaced, wide-margined bio will ever be. When this dude [testifies](http://www.lessig.org/content/testimony/) before the Supreme Court (Napster, Microsoft, Net neutrality), you _know_ which way Kennedy will swing. &#8220;Law&#8221; is part of his _name_, for Chrissakes. Dissent is not an option.

Seriously, though&#8211;Lessig is currently &#8220;off the grid,&#8221; but his blog [archives](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/) are well worth checking out. His post categories include &#8220;good law&#8221; (free speech, free music, &#8220;Free Culture&#8221;), &#8220;bad law&#8221; (Internet regulations, piracy crackdowns, antiquated patent systems), and, bless his heart, &#8220;just plain silly.&#8221; If you want a primer on the issues that will shape the media in the coming decades, but law school isn&#8217;t your bag, then read this blog.&nbsp;

The guy clearly loves the exchange of ideas, and the potential of blogs to facilitate discourse gets his blood pumping. He even created an [Anti-Lessig Wiki](http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php/Anti-Lessig_Reader) for people who disagree with him (notice it&#8217;s empty). But the rise of blogs and amateur journalists is not 100% good news, he [writes](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002926.shtml). The problem &#8220;is not bloggers tempted by ad revenues. It is instead the emergence of the equivalent of tabloids in blog-space: commercial entities whose sole purpose is to generate ad revenue, who do that by being as ridiculous and extreme as possible.&#8221; Larry, please. We do this because we love it.
