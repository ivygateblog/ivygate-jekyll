While flipping through a discarded UVA alumni magazine at the gym _[Ed.: They&#8217;re letting Wahoos into Park Slope now?]_, we came across this charming letter to the editor:

> It would seem there is a disturbing trend of pro-gay advocacy in _Alumni News_. In the class notes section, which I always look forward to reading, I was disturbed to read a proud &#8220;new parents&#8221; announcement of a girl to a pair of men.
> 
> Some on your editorial staff may think that this is progressive, politically correct and reflective of changing attitudes toward the family and marriage. To me, it is an insult to the core of society: the family. In the sad wake of the sexual revolution, there is already tons of data by sociologists that children raised in a home with a mother and father with whom they have a biological connection are the most stable, and less likely to fall into adolescent delinquency, substance abuse, teenage sex, etc. If the aim of the University is to serve society, then we need to foster an environment that helps strong citizens to grow and develop, and not just benchmark the steps taken by different persons as if any choice is equivalent.
> 
> I ask you if it is reasonable to endorse with normalcy the actions of a fringe of people that affect the foundations of society.
> 
> _Barbara Ellen Spencer (Col &#8217;83)
  
> New Delhi, India_

Yes, yes, this could just be the regressive ramblings of one cranky alum. Except the previous letter happens to be from someone disputing the Big Bang theory on the grounds that it sounds too crazy. Looking good, UVA. Lookin&#8217; good.
