<img width="150" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="250" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/438028.jpg" alt="The <em>Real</em> REAL Game" />It&#8217;s been well-documented by now that The Game &#8212; Harvard and Yale&#8217;s annual gridiron battle &#8212; is hardly worth its title. It&#8217;s even been [suggested](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/the_game_barely_deserves_obnoxious_caps_this_year.html) that tomorrow&#8217;s showdown between Princeton and Yale should now be dubbed &#8220;The REAL Game.&#8221;

But only one game is of any real importance this weekend, and that&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Harvard-Cornell hockey matchup &#8212; a rivalry so tough and bitter that it left the insane-screaming-and-body-paint end of the spectrum and re-entered on the side of [sappy <strike>Richard Gere</strike> movies](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/love-story.jpg).

This game is actually important &#8212; Harvard just pulled a huge upset over the No. 3 team in the country and Cornell is ranked 11th in the nation. But if the Big Bad, Big Red athletic department [gets its way](http://cornellbigred.cstv.com/sports/m-hockey/spec-rel/110806aac.html), the best part of this rivalry will disappear: the throwing of dead fish at Harvard hockey players.

The tradition has been in effect since 1973. It started with a Harvard fan throwing a chicken on the ice, which was apparently a crack at the fact that Cornell has an agriculture school (witty!). The Big Red faithful responded by throwing fish, a reference to Boston&#8217;s love of seafood (wittier!).

But the funniest tradition is the one the Cornell Athletic Department is trying to start: bringing a stuffed animal to the game to give to charity. Haha, getting Ivy Leaguers to give up booze and debauchery for charity. Good one.
