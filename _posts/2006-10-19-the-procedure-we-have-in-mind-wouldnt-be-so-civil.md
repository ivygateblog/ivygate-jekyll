Caminker](http://cgi2.www.law.umich.edu/_FacultyBioPage/facultybiopagenew.asp?ID=40), dean of Michigan Law (and a Yale J.D.).

When we first heard of the contest, we briefly considered organizing a ballot-stuffing campaign on behalf of the Ivy candidates &#8212; until we realized that that would have been pretty much the same thing as saying &#8220;Vote.&#8221;

Which of the [male nominees](http://www.abovethelaw.com/2006/10/law_school_dean_hotties_your_m_1.php) had Ivy pedigrees? Thanks for asking. All of them, with the exception of this [Brett Favre look-alike](http://law.pepperdine.edu/academics/faculty/gash.html). There was less domination on the [female ballot](http://www.abovethelaw.com/2006/10/law_school_dean_hotties_your_f_1.php), but Rangappa took an early lead and never tossed her raven hair to look back. Well done, victors. Whether you top [this scorching pair](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/prof_cannon_prof_wolff_is_there_anything_we_can_do_to_raise_this_grade.html) is for the jury to decide.
