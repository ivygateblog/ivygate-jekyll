Kaavya's First Post-Plagiarism Writing" />Obsessed as we are with the Kaavya Viswanathan [of the moment](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/alright_were_just_gonna_say_it_hes_the_new_kaavya.html), we almost forgot to keep tabs on Kaavya 1.0!

The [critically acclaimed](http://www.gawker.com/news/kaavya-viswanathan/) author of _How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life_ has resurfaced with what we believe is her first piece of post-plagiarism writing: a profile of Janet Hanson for a glossy magazine put out by [Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business](http://www.huwib.org/).

Our verdict: Not a bad piece, really &#8212; guess Kaavya can write after all. Except she kinda buries the lede:

> &#8220;When asked what piece of advice she would give other aspiring businesswomen, Janet doesn&#8217;t hesitate. &#8216;Maintain integrity at all costs,&#8217; she says. &#8216;Personal integrity is the most important quality anyone can have, no matter what you&#8217;re doing. You need people who will recommend you without a single reservation.&#8217; &#8220;

Too late, Janet. Too late.
