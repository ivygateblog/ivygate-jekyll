Romney, the Republican governor who wants to be president when he grows up, [won&#8217;t be providing](http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/09/06/romney_bars_state_security_for_iranians_harvard_visit/) [state security](http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/09/06/romney_bars_state_security_for_iranians_harvard_visit/) to protect Mohammad Khatami during his visit on Monday, Sept. 11. Romney doesn&#8217;t want tax dollars being spent on protecting a &#8220;terrorist,&#8221; he said. Wise man. Not only is he not letting the terrorists win, he&#8217;s letting _our_ terrorists win instead! With knuckle sandwiches!

Never mind that Khatami ran as a reform candidate and fought, albeit unsuccessfully, to curb the power of Iran&#8217;s Gaurdian Council and expand press freedoms. Is it possible Romney was thinking of [someone else](http://home.gwi.net/~jscarp/images/ahmadinejad_79.JPG)? Mohammad, Mahmoud &#8212; what&#8217;s the difference, right Mitt?

**Afterthought:** Why a lecture? If Harvard knew its audience, they&#8217;d stage a steel cage match between Prof. Samuel [P.](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/100huntington.jpg) &#8220;Clash of Civilizations&#8221; Huntington&nbsp;and Mohammad &#8220;Dialogue Among Civilizations&#8221; Khatami. We&#8217;re betting on the guy with the centrifuges.
