Whatever you may think of him, new Cornell President David J. Skorton has one hell of a PR team. Aww, he&#8217;s living in a [freshman dorm](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/cornellgasm_president_skortons_first_day.html)! Gee, he sure can wail on the sax! Golly, he&#8217;s even&nbsp;got&nbsp;his own&nbsp;[ice cream flavor](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/09/breaking_skorton_ice_cream_delicious.html)!&nbsp;We were just getting ready to consummate our Skorton-love,&nbsp;with the Right Reverend Zuckerberg presiding (i.e., friend him), when we saw this:&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now this is just weird. We know students are supposed to welcome the new boss. But to friend him beyond the Facebook-decreed limits for friendship? What happened to rebellion?

Cornell hasn&#8217;t just drunk Skorton&#8217;s Kool-Aid; it&#8217;s been doing keg-stands.&nbsp;Read Skorton&#8217;s [inaugural speech](http://www.cornellsun.com/node/18146).&nbsp;He squeezed the Cornell experience into some awkward dancing metaphor,&nbsp;concluding, &#8220;One alone, a dyad, more, many, a society of dancers are we.&#8221; Any self-respecting Cornellian,&nbsp;after&nbsp;hearing this,&nbsp;would have run home&nbsp;and filled out a transfer request. The absence of backlash, though, tells us that it may be too late. Golden Boy Skorton has officially brainwashed Cornell, one friend request at a time. IvyGate is now <span class="c1">officially skeptical</span>.
