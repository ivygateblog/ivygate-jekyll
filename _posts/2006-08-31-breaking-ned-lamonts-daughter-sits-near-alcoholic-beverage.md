Yep, we saw this one coming. It was only a matter of time before Emily Lamont, Harvard &#8217;09, fulfilled her filial obligation to embarrass her father Ned&#8217;s senatorial candidacy. This adorable shot shows Emily moments away from a can of Coors Light and a beer funnel. Now, it&#8217;s not 100 percent clear if that Coors is meant for her or that sweet dude in baby blue Lacoste. But we&#8217;re pretty sure the laws of physics say the person closer to the floor takes the rip.

See, Ned? This is what happens when you get the netroots involved! Lieberman, you owe us bigtime. Team Lamont, send angy e-mail [here](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com).

UPDATE 10:04 a.m.: The gentleman appears to be Michael Libert, Harvard &#8217;09.&nbsp;
