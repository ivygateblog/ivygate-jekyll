Kind of Like College" />Boy, are statistics exciting! Don&#8217;t know about you, but we spent all weekend curled up with a pint of Chubby Hubby and our bundle of joy &#8212; the $9.95 _U.S. News_ guide to America&#8217;s Best Colleges.

Here&#8217;s a quick guide to the guide, if you will:

p. 11 &#8212; **&#8220;One way [colleges] win you over is to play hard to get.&#8221;** It&#8217;s true: college admissions is a complex seduction. So approach it as you would any romance. Start by pretending the school doesn&#8217;t exist. Then, at an Ivy Summit, get it drunk and just start showing up for classes. It worked with Yale, that slut.

p. 16 &#8212; **&#8220;Qualified men &#8230; can find themselves in a more advantageous position&#8211;so much so that college counserlors have begun advising some men to &#8217;emphasize their maleness.&#8217; &#8220;** Many applications now include, next to &#8220;height&#8221; and &#8220;weight&#8221;, &#8220;girth.&#8221;

&nbsp;p. 24 &#8212; **&#8220;[O]ne student from a public high school in central Pennsylvania decided the Ivy League wasn&#8217;t for him; he preferred a lower-pressure academic environment.&#8221;** Well-meaning slacker-to-be, meet Brown University.

p. 32 &#8212; **&#8220;A complicated wine-appreciation course &#8230; is reputed to be [Cornell&#8217;s] most failed course, with roughly 25 of the 600 undergrads enrolled each year receiving an F.&#8221;** Failing. At drinking. Sorry, Cornell, but what is it you do well again?

p. 73&#8211;**&#8220;Research shows that more than half of freshmen go to their first party within the first week of school.&#8221;** Next week: _U.S. News_ reveals what university is named after John Harvard.
