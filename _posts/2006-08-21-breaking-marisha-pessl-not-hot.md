Betrayed! Today&#8217;s _Times_ has a [story](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/books/21pess.html) on just how hot [Marisha Pessl](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/marisha_pessl_wont_get_fooled_again.html) is &#8230; which they chose to illustrate with a photo that is **NOT HOT AT ALL**. It&#8217;s the most egregious display of [two-face](http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheStrike.htm) we&#8217;ve ever witnessed. See for yourselves:

Deceiver! [Janus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(mythology)) of the ingenue-lit set! Now we will have to judge your novel on its merits!
