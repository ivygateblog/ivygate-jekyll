MBA candidates: They&#8217;re funny! Really! Not to be outdone by some [Bay Area interloper](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/07/you_know_how_they_say_we_only_use_10_percent_of_our_brains_i_say_we_only_use_10_percent_of_excel_functionality.html), the Columbia Business School joins the _I&#8217;m Gonna Be Rich &#8230;_ And _Funny!_ battle with aplomb. Besting Stanford in Gay X Factor (it&#8217;s The Police) and self-deprecation, CBS dean Glenn Hubbard simply dazzles in this aching missive to Fed Chairman Benjamin Bernanke.
