Dear Mr. Corey-Boulet:

Please. We&#8217;re begging you. Update [browndailyherald.com](http://www.browndailyherald.com). We don&#8217;t live in Providence. Brown Orientation starts today, and we don&#8217;t have a stoner&#8217;s clue what&#8217;s happening up there. [This](http://post.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper745/news/2006/07/17/FromTheEditors/Welcome.To.College-2131956.shtml), while funny and admirably ahead of schedule, was not enough. Brown&#8217;s new web site [scares us](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/brown_slowly_phases_out_students_phases_in_sandalclad_cyborgs.html). All we have to go on is these deans&#8217; [boring letter](http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/orientation/) to new students, and while we haven&#8217;t actually read the whole thing (something about &#8220;developing Advising Partnerships&#8221; and &#8220;how to live and learn as individuals while respecting others&#8221;) we&#8217;re pretty sure it doesn&#8217;t include the word &#8220;shitfaced&#8221; at any point, so it can&#8217;t be too relevant.

All those thousands of Brown-nosers pouring into Providence &#8230; us, sitting here in the dark &#8230; Have a heart, Mr. Corey-Boulet. Update your goddamn newspaper from _July 17th_.

Beseechingly,
