It&#8217;s no surprise that Brown has a group of students who regularly dress up as pirates. That they do so while singing a cappella and calling themselves [&#8220;ARRR!!!&#8221;](http://www.arrr.net/) is impressive even by Brown standards of dedicated lunacy.

A correspondent tells us that ARRR!!! (&#8220;three r&#8217;s, three !&#8217;s&#8221;) performed a holiday concert Sunday night. Rather than unleashing the usual harmless irony we&#8217;ve come to expect from pirates, they proceeded to burn every religious group there with the following questionable rendition of &#8220;Oh Come All Ye Faithful&#8221;:

> Oh come all ye faithful
  
> Easily Offended
  
> After you hear our song
  
> Your hearts won&#8217;t be pure.
  
> Jews, Christians, Arabs
  
> No one is off limits
  
> So if you are tight-ass
  
> Locate the nearest exit
  
> (It may be behind you)
  
> Follow the lights&#8230;
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> As [Mary] was sleeping
  
> Three wise-men came a-creeping
  
> And back behind the ferns
  
> The wisemen took their turns
  
> And now her loin burns
  
> with Christ the Lord

Later lyrics detailed Chanukah raids on Jewish cities, the difficulties of squaring buccaneer life with Ramadan restrictions, and numbering STDs acquired to the 12 days of Christmas. (Between this and reports of roaming ninjas, Brown is drowning in its own kitsch). No audio of the concert, but here are a few tracks from their recent album, &#8220;Spontaneous Rumbustion!&#8221;:
