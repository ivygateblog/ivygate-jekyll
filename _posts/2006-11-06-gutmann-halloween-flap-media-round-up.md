<img width="174" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="250" border="1" align="right" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/gutmann.jpg" alt="Gutmann Halloween Flap: Media Round-Up" />Ever since [posing for a Halloween photo](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/11/maybe_next_year_amy_gutmann_can_dress_up_as_a_nonpr_disaster.html) with a student dressed as a suicide bomber, Penn President Amy Gutmann has been getting star treatment from the Ivy League watchdog cottage industry. Congrats, Amy, you&#8217;re famous! Here&#8217;s a quick rundown: &nbsp;

  * The _New York Post_ naturally takes the prize for [most creative headline](http://www.nypost.com/seven/11042006/news/nationalnews/ditzy_ivy_prexys_hween_ball_bombs_nationalnews_david_andreatta.htm), &#8220;DITZY IVY PREXY H&#8217;WEEN BALL BOMBS.&#8221;
  * _The Weekly Standard_ [puts on](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/904ppnhh.asp) a frowny face: &#8220;The images are, in fact, disturbingly familiar: Sympathizers of suicide-bombers in the Middle East routinely show solidarity with their &#8216;freedom fighters&#8217; by dressing children up in the same type of costumes, complete with plastic dynamite and fake AK-47s.&#8221;
  * _The Jerusalem Post_ is [not psyched](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1162378324729&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull) about Saadi calling himself a &#8220;freedom martyr.&#8221;&nbsp;
  * See the _Daily Pennsylvanian_ for an [account](http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/11/06/News/Student.Regrets.Photos.Not.Bomber.Getup-2441494.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) that actually acknowledges that the costume was meant to be a joke. Saad Saadi, the student in the photo, says he regrets the photo, but not the costume. Is that one of those &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re offended&#8221; apologies? The piece quotes Anti-Defmation League official Barry Morrison: &#8220;No right-thinking individual ought to go around in [this] costume unless [he or she] is a suicide bomber or wants to be one.&#8221;
  * The _DP_ also runs a [full-length interview](http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/11/06/News/Saadi.a.Controversial.Celebrity-2441209.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) with Saadi: &#8220;It&#8217;s the same as dressing up as anything scary.&#8221;
  * Gutmann also [apologizes](http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/11/06/Opinion/Guest.Opinion.Amy.Gutmann.Reponse.From.The.President-2441124.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) in a guest opinion column, noting that at a party featuring ax murderers, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that someone could create an actually offensive costume, but at least one of our students did.&#8221;

Honestly? Unless you&#8217;re going as a Katrina refugee named Terri Schiavo with a stingray sticking out of your chest that sends sexual IMs to Congressional pages &#8230; we&#8217;re not impressed.
