People [just](http://www.eduwonk.com/) [can&#8217;t](http://06520-2848.blogspot.com/) [get](http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/tools/papertrail/) [enough](http://www.sexandtheivy.com/) [of](http://lifeatharvard.com/) [this](http://www.dartblog.com/) [blogging](http://ohharvard.blogspot.com/) [game](http://www.metaezra.com/). [As](http://ivycatholic.blogspot.com/) [if](http://www.stuffonmycat.com/) [suddenly](http://www.samjackson.org/college/) [everyone](http://coalitionofthethrilling.blogspot.com/) [got](http://thelittlegreenblog.blogspot.com/) [something](http://prez.wordpress.com/) [to](http://hillwindjournals.blogspot.com/) [say](http://goldivy.blogspot.com/) [about](http://fartlog.blogspot.com/) [Ivies](http://www.02138mag.com/editorial/index.html). [Seriously](http://www.ivygateblog.com/blog-mt/www.bwog.net). [It&#8217;s](http://cornell.elliottback.com/) [frightening](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/?section=1). ([Remember the prophecy?](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/08/year_of_the_college_blog_begins_now.html).)

So it was only a matter of time, really, before the bureaucratic heffalump that is _The Harvard Crimson_ got on board. The Plympton Street broadsheet gave birth to triplets this week: [Pablog](http://www.thecrimson.com/blog_summary.aspx?blogID=25), [Lehman&#8217;s Picks](http://www.thecrimson.com/blog_summary.aspx?blogID=24) and [Ivy Links](http://www.thecrimson.com/blog_summary.aspx?blogID=23), all about sports, all kind of hard to tell apart at this point.

But the real new family member is [Ivy Infusion](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514686), a &#8220;Web Exclusive&#8221; chameleon that has us scratching our heads. It looks like a blog &#8230; And snarks like a blog &#8230; But it&#8217;s published once a day as a full article? A _Crim-_ed assures us it will soon adopt a &#8220;more traditional blog format.&#8221; Whatever. We&#8217;re already dropping trou for the thorough caning we expect to receive at the hands of their scoop-tacular reporters.

We&#8217;ll be reading, fellas. Try not to break the needle on the insularometer.

**Bonus:** _The Crimson_ [shows us some love](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514697).
