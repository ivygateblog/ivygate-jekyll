_In the second installment of [**Blog Man on Campus**](http://www.ivygateblog.com/blog_man_on_campus/), our occasional Ivy bloviation spotlight, our correspondent finds yet more worthwhile scrawlings somewhere outside Boston &#8230;_

Kameron Collins &#8217;09 is a Harvard student, and black, and his blog [**I am not my Hair**](http://harvardhair.blogspot.com/) deals in part with those issues. But his blog isn&#8217;t _about_ what it&#8217;s like to be black and at Harvard &#8212; it&#8217;s about what it&#8217;s like to be lots of things. What it&#8217;s like to be anybody at Harvard. What it&#8217;s like to miss dating but be scared of it. What it&#8217;s like to smile when you see a white person get pulled over and wonder if it makes you a bad person.

So, yes, he&#8217;s just another self-aware, sexually frustrated denizen of Cambridge. So why is his standard this-is-my-life-and-these-are-my-frustrations format so _addictive_?

Maybe because it&#8217;s so [quotable](http://harvardhair.blogspot.com/2006/08/blog-post-of-day.html): &#8220;Of course ugly people are bitter. Ugly people at Harvard are, I think, even worse &#8211; because not only are they bitter, they&#8217;re passionate about it.&#8221; To which the only thing I can think to add is: Seriously!

This is not to say that Harvardhair is all Kameron all the time. The blog is particularly strong where it deals with race, especially since it&#8217;s so difficult for anybody to talk about it on campus. Kameron avoids abstractions and delves right into uncomfortable particulars. Why, he [wonders](http://harvardhair.blogspot.com/2006/10/average-nice-white-guy-what-you-hadnt.html), does the stereotype of the &#8220;average nice white guy&#8221; have no hispanic or African counterpart? The closest one he can identify is the Upstanding Black Gentleman, who isn&#8217;t average at all. Also, you gotta hand it to anyone ballsy enough to post [poetry](http://harvardhair.blogspot.com/2006/11/poem-i-yesterday-when-i-fell-asleep-to.html) on his blog.

Kameron, may the <strike>ladies</strike> boys swarm to your blog. And if not that, to your inevitable book deal.

**UPDATE 1:55 p.m.:&nbsp;** Whoops! A friend of Kameron&#8217;s emails us to correct that last line.
