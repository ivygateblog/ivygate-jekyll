Dan Savage is a favorite of ours for editing Seattle&#8217;s _The Stranger_ alt-weekly and for writing &#8220;Savage Love,&#8221; a bludgeoning sex advice column that runs in papers like _The Onion_ and the _Village Voice_. And he&#8217;s a hero for re-defining the word &#8220;[Santorum](http://www.spreadingsantorum.com)&#8221; after the frothy Pennsylvania senator gave a despicable interview linking gays and bestiality.

But this video interview Savage gave the _Daily Pennsylvanian_ on Keystone State politics seems a little &#8212; what&#8217;s the word? &#8212; crazy. Everything&#8217;s cruising along until he says Green Party candidate Carl Romanelli should be &#8220;dragged behind a pickup truck until there&#8217;s nothing left <strike>of</strike> but the rope.&#8221; Notes the _DP_&#8216;s Stephen Morse, &#8220;This was by far the [most insane interview](http://lamp.dailypennsylvanian.com/blogs/index.php?page=post&section=2&id=364) that I&#8217;ve ever conducted.&#8221;
