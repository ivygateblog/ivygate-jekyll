Was his GPA too low? Did he have discipline problems? Do they suspect his involvement in a certain [kidnapping](http://www.ivygateblog.com/2006/10/breaking_brown_kidnappers_issue_list_of_demands_1.html)?

Nope. Penn&#8217;s president and dean of admissions felt it [would make Penn too good at basketball and Brown too bad](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/07/20/Sports/Jeppesen.Staying.Put.At.Brown-2144128.shtml?norewrite200612041521&sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com). From the _DP_:

> &#8220;We feel badly about taking students from Brown, a member of our league,&#8221; [dean Lee Stetson said]. Stetson stressed that **the decision had nothing to do with academic standards.** Rather, he cited a desire for fairness and a concern for the integrity of a fellow Ivy League institution.
> 
> President Amy Gutmann &#8220;and I talked, and we just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to take someone from the other Ivies,&#8221; Stetson said. &#8220;It just isn&#8217;t fair. He is a Brown student, he chose to go to Brown, and we&#8217;re hoping he flourishes there. He made his choice, and Brown is his place, just like we would not want to have students taken out from underneath of our program at Penn.&#8221;

Jeppesen &#8212; who, we should probably point out, is a human being and not just a thing that dribbles &#8212; was faced with returning to a school and a team he didn&#8217;t like. So he&#8217;s opted to [drop out of school](http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2006/12/04/Sports/Jeppesen.Off.Team.And.Out.Of.Brown-2519908.shtml?norewrite200612041531&sourcedomain=www.dailypennsylvanian.com).

Jeppesen is by all accounts a great kid, and certainly a terrific athlete. He lost his chance to earn an Ivy League degree because a couple of academics decided to stick their noses in an arena they know very little about. Somebody [let us know](mailto:ivygate@gmail.com) the next time these two give a speech about &#8220;student-athletes&#8221; with a straight face.
