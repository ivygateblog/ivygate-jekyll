While it&#8217;s tempting to quote from another of Tupac&#8217;s oeuvre (&#8220;R U Still Down,&#8221; track 11), we hear you: the redesign is not the belle of the ball. (To the class acts who comment in CAPS with lots!!!! of punctuation!!!!: We hear you loudest of all! Totally keep it up!)

It comes as a bit of a surprise &#8212; almost everyone we showed it to in beta was a fan &#8212; but we think we&#8217;ve figured out why: We only, uh, looked at the damn thing in Firefox. A plurality of you (44.17 percent, Google says) are here via Internet Explorer, and in that claptrap of a browser this site&#8217;s about as organized as a Buckingham Palace genome.

To improve things, we gotta know if what you&#8217;re seeing matches how it&#8217;s supposed to look (click to embiggen):

We also should have done a better job explaining what the goals are:

  * Move a second headline &#8220;above the fold&#8221; on larger monitors
  * Move recent comments higher, so you don&#8217;t have to scroll down
  * Yeah, move advertising up; we&#8217;re trying to get our hourly wage from $1 to $2
  * Make comments stand out from each other ([click here](http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/redesign2big.png) to see how that&#8217;s supposed to look)
  * Make better use of widescreen monitors
  
    (**Left margin problems?** Maximize, kids: only 2.4 percent of you have screens smaller than this 1024-pixel layout.)
  * Get one of those sweet-ass icons in the address bar

Still dislike the facelift? Go ahead and pile it on in the comments; the Web is good for nothing if not angry mobs. As we fix the IE stuff, we&#8217;ll pay attention and tinker with other things as well.

In closing, we quote another great American visionary. &#8220;And so tonight &#8212; to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans &#8212; I ask for your support.&#8221;
