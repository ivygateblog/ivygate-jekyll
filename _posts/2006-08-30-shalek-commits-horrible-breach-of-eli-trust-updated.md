<img width="200" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="300" border="1" align="left" src="http://www.ivygateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/shalek.jpg" alt="Shalek Commits Horrible Breach of Eli Trust (UPDATED)" />This just in &#8212; to us, anyway: New Haven alderman Nick Shalek (Yale &#8217;05) was arrested 2 a.m. Sunday and charged with breach of the peace and other crimes after a donnybrook outside the Salty Dog Cafe, the [YDN reports](http://www.yaledailynews.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=32970).

Shalek, a former captain of the hockey team and president of the Yale Entrepreneurial Society, had landed a sweet post-graduation job working for the Yale Investment Office (the endowment), before running for alderman in the city&#8217;s first ward, which covers Old Campus and most of the residential colleges. We hear he&#8217;s a nice guy, and look at that handsome mug; he&#8217;s pretty much all you could ask for in a Yalie.

So it&#8217;s not that a public official was brawling in the streets that bothers us. It&#8217;s the fact that he was arrested at the Salty Dog Cafe, clearly a cheesy-ass towny hangout. Et tu, Shalek? You&#8217;re one of them now?

UPDATE 10:42 a.m.: It&#8217;s the Salty Dog Saloon, not Cafe. Even more cheesy. Even more towny.

UPDATE x2: All charges have been dropped, says a reliable source.
