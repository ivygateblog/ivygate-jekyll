Does anyone here own a shotgun? If so, could you get it to us by, say, next Friday?

A reader just forwarded us the following invitation for an upcoming Smirnoff promotional party at the Princeton Club, hosted by the Andover/Abbot Academy of New York. On Friday the 13th. We haven&#8217;t touched a word, much like we wouldn&#8217;t touch a grisly rape scene if we worked for CSI.

> You&#8217;ve seen the Prep Unit video on You-Tube and now we&#8217;re going to raise the roof in the Princeton Club. That&#8217;s right, all you prepsta brothers and sisters, we&#8217;re having a Tea Partay. Every OP (Original Prepsta) is going to be there getting his swerve on, his dance on, his whale print belt, Nantucket Reds and Topsiders on and most definitely, his ice cold Smirnoff Raw Tea on. We&#8217;re going to have the Lemon, Peach and Raspberry flavas in effect &#8217;cause that&#8217;s how we roll. So get ready to raise that Smirnoff Raw Tea, and let&#8217;s shake some ivy.
